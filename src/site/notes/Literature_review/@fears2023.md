>
> Autistic children have differences in their movements which impact their functional performance. Virtual-reality enables researchers to study movement in safe, engaging environments. We used motion-capture to measure how 7‚Äì13-year-old autistic and neurotypical children make whole-body movements in a virtual-reality task. Although children in both groups were successful, we observed differences in their movements. Autistic children were less efficient moving to the target. Autistic children did not appear to use a movement strategy. While neurotypical children were more likely to overshoot near targets and undershoot far targets, autistic children did not modulate their strategy. Using kinematic data from tasks in virtual-reality, we can begin to understand the pattern of movement challenges experienced by autistic children.

## üìå Summary

- The study investigates the differences in whole-body goal-directed movements between autistic and neurotypical children using virtual reality and motion capture.
- Autistic children were less efficient in their movements, taking longer and using less direct paths.
- Autistic children showed less strategy modulation compared to neurotypical peers, particularly when adjusting for target distance.
- The findings suggest potential implications for daily activities, highlighting the need for tailored motor interventions.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- Experimental study using immersive virtual reality to analyze movement efficiency, variability, and accuracy.

### Participants

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age (Mean ¬± SD)|Age Range|Additional Characteristics|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Autistic|16|14/2|10.63 ¬± 1.82|7-13|Confirmed ASD diagnosis via ADOS-2 and ADI-R|
|Neurotypical|12|7/5|9.25 ¬± 1.91|7-13|No ASD diagnosis or related family history|

### Tasks for Participants

- Participants performed the Safe Zone Task, moving a virtual ball to a green safe zone by shifting their body laterally.

|Task Component|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|
|Safe Zone Task|Measure goal-directed movement|VR-mediated body movement|Success rate, time, path efficiency|
|Near vs. Far Zones|Assess strategy modulation|Varying target distances|Overshoot/undershoot rates|
|Trial Learning|Assess learning effect over trials|16 repeated trials|Trial duration, success changes|

### System Setup and Hardware

|Device|Purpose|Specifications|
|---|---|---|
|CAREN VR System|Virtual reality environment|V-Gait system with motion tracking|
|Motion Analysis Cameras|Track movement|12-camera 120 Hz infrared setup|
|MATLAB|Data processing|Custom analysis scripts|
|Reflective Markers|Track participant movement|Placed on anatomical landmarks|

### Data Analysis

|Feature|Task Relationship|Measurement Approach|
|---|---|---|
|Trial Duration|Measure task completion time|Time from task start to target entry|
|Path Efficiency|Assess movement strategy|Path ratio: actual vs. optimal path|
|Path Variability|Analyze movement consistency|Coefficient of variability|
|Overshoots|Strategy for near targets|Movements passing the target|
|Undershoots|Strategy for far targets|Movements stopping before the target|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings

- Autistic children were equally successful but took longer to complete the task.
- Movements of autistic children were less efficient and followed less direct paths.
- Neurotypical children adapted their strategy for near and far targets; autistic children did not.
- Path variability was higher for both groups when targeting near distances.

### Implications

- Motor differences in autism may contribute to daily activity challenges.
- Movement inefficiencies may increase fatigue and reduce engagement in activities.
- VR-based motor assessments could help tailor interventions for autistic children.

## üîç Related Work

- Prior studies show autistic individuals have differences in postural control and upper-body movements.
- Movement differences may stem from altered visuomotor integration and motor planning.
- The study extends previous findings by focusing on whole-body movements in dynamic contexts.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- Innovative use of immersive VR with precise motion capture.
- Detailed analysis of task strategy differences.
- Practical implications for intervention development.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Limited sample size reduces generalizability.
- Possible learning effects from repeated trials were not extensively analyzed.
- The exclusion criteria were strict, potentially omitting relevant motor profiles.
- The study did not examine long-term motor adaptation or daily task performance impact.
