> [!Abstract]
>
> The high prevalence of autism calls for accessible and scalable technology-assisted screening tools. This will aid in early detection allowing timely access to services and supports. SenseToKnow, a mobile digital phenotyping app, showed potential in eliciting autism-related behaviors that can be automatically captured via computer vision analysis (CVA) in toddlers. Here, we present the capability of SenseToKnow in characterizing autism in school age children and showcase the robustness of the CVA features in interpreting distinct and overlapping behaviors with attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD).
