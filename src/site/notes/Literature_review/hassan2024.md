> [!Abstract]
>
> Nowadays, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a compound neurodevelopmental disorder that affects millions of persons universally, impacting their communication, communal interaction, and behavior. ASD is a diverse condition that exhibits differently in each individual, from trivial complications with social cues to severe challenges with parallel communication. ASD has become a demanding concern for healthcare professionals, and educationalists, highlighting the need for early detection, effective intervention, and wide-ranging support systems. As a result, an approach has proposed for predicting ASD at early stages, as the existing models have overfitting, class imbalance and more complexity problems. To overcome these issues a hybrid model of eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression (XGBoost-LR) has proposed, which involves with preprocessing of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Standard Scalar Standardization to balance class and to improve interpretability. Next, feature extraction is performed with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and cross validation using 5foldCV to reduce overfitting and improve generalizability. The XGBoost-LR model gives a precise rate in predicting and classifying the stages of ASD. The proposed XGBoost-LR model gives the better results than the other existing methods Support Vector Machine (SVM) in terms of metrices accuracy, precision, recall, specificity and f1 score respectively.
