> [!Abstract]
>
> <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a worldwide prevalence of about 1%, characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication, repetitive patterns of behaviors, and can be associated with hyper- or hypo-reactivity of sensory stimulation and cognitive disability. ASD comorbid features include internalizing and externalizing symptoms such as anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, and attention problems. The precise etiology of ASD is still unknown and it is undoubted that the disorder is linked to some extent to both genetic and environmental factors. It is also well-documented and known that one of the most striking and consistent finding in ASD is the higher prevalence in males compared to females, with around 70% of ASD cases described being males. The present review looked into the most significant studies that attempted to investigate differences in ASD males and females thus trying to shade some light on the peculiar characteristics of this prevalence in terms of diagnosis, imaging, major autistic-like behavior and sex-dependent uniqueness. The study also discussed sex differences found in animal models of ASD, to provide a possible explanation of the neurological mechanisms underpinning the different presentation of autistic symptoms in males and females.</p>

### Behavioral and Cognitive Biomarkers in ASD: Sex-Specific Differences

|**Biomarker Category**|**Biomarker**|**Males with ASD**|**Females with ASD**|**Neurobiological/Behavioral Basis**|**Clinical Implications**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Social Interaction**|Eye Contact|Reduced eye contact; prefers objects|Better eye contact but struggles with social cues|Dysfunction in fusiform face area & amygdala|Early eye-tracking assessments for social attention|
||Gaze Alternation|Lower frequency of gaze shifts between faces & objects|Higher gaze alternation but less consistent focus|Impaired superior colliculus function|Use gaze alternation tasks in diagnostic settings|
||Social Motivation|Low social engagement; prefers mechanical objects|Higher motivation but less meaningful engagement|Altered connectivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex|Use of camouflaging scales for better detection in females|
|**Repetitive Behaviors**|Stereotyped Movements|More visible repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand flapping)|More subtle repetitive behaviors (e.g., hair twirling)|Basal ganglia hyperactivity|Observation-based assessments for both overt and covert behaviors|
||Restricted Interests|Focus on mechanical objects (e.g., trains, gadgets)|Intense focus on socially aligned interests (e.g., animals)|Prefrontal cortex hyperconnectivity|Gender-adapted interest inventories for early screening|
|**Sensory Processing**|Sensory Hyperreactivity|More tolerant to sensory stimuli|Heightened sensitivity to sound, touch, smell|Dysfunction in thalamocortical pathways|Sensory profile screening during early developmental stages|
||Sensory Hyporeactivity|Frequently under-reacts to social stimuli|Less hyporeactive but slower adaptation|Impaired sensory integration in somatosensory cortex|Tailored interventions for sensory desensitization|
|**Eye-Tracking Biomarkers**|Fixation Duration|Longer fixation on objects than faces|More balanced fixation but less meaningful gaze|Reduced activation of the social brain network|Use of dynamic social videos in assessment|
||Saccade Latency|Longer time to initiate saccades|Faster but less accurate saccades|Impaired frontal eye fields and superior colliculus|Anti-saccade tasks for assessing impulse control|
||Pupil Dilation to Faces|Reduced pupil dilation to emotional faces|Greater pupil response to faces|Dysregulation of autonomic nervous system|Pupillometry for emotional response assessment|
|**Cognitive Function**|Attention Control|High distractibility, impulsive responses|Better control but easily fatigued|Prefrontal cortex hypoactivation|Attention assessments considering cognitive load differences|
||Cognitive Flexibility|Rigid thought patterns, struggles with change|Greater flexibility but perseverative thinking|Prefrontal cortex & anterior cingulate cortex involvement|Adaptive cognitive exercises targeting flexibility|
||Executive Function|Poor working memory, impulsivity|Better executive control but more anxiety|Impaired dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|Cognitive training programs tailored to sex differences|
|**Emotional Regulation**|Anxiety|Lower anxiety, more externalizing behaviors|Higher anxiety, more internalizing symptoms|Overactivation of the amygdala & hypothalamus|Anxiety-specific screening tools for ASD females|
||Depression|Lower prevalence, more irritability|Higher prevalence, often missed due to ASD symptoms|Prefrontal cortex dysfunction|Routine mood screening during adolescence|
|**Language and Communication**|Pragmatic Language|Delayed development, monotone speech|Typical development with pragmatic deficits|Impaired temporal lobe connectivity|Use of natural conversation tasks in diagnosis|
||Echolalia|More obvious repetition of phrases|Subtle, less noticeable echolalia|Disrupted left hemisphere language areas|Narrative-based assessments for real-time conversation monitoring|

### **Key Insights**

- **Social Interaction & Communication:** Females often mask deficits, leading to underdiagnosis, while males present with more overt symptoms.
- **Repetitive Behaviors & Interests:** Males show typical ASD behaviors, whereas females' interests align with gender-normative topics, complicating recognition.
- **Sensory Processing:** Females tend to have more hypersensitivity across sensory modalities.
- **Cognitive Profiles:** Males show more hyperactivity and impulsivity; females exhibit more anxiety and emotional regulation difficulties.
- **Eye-Tracking:** Provides objective data on social attention, visual preferences, and emotional responsiveness.
