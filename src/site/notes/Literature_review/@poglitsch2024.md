> [!Abstract]
>
> In this paper, we present a systematic review of the applications of (1) Extended Reality (XR), (2) Augmented Reality (AR), and (3) Virtual Reality (VR) technologies to enhance emotion recognition and emotion expression in people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ASD can affect various abilities, and poses challenges to the recognition of emotions in others, which is often referred to as “social blindness”. Treating this condition typically requires intensive one-on-one or small-group therapy sessions, which can be costly and limited in terms of availability. With the growing number of diagnoses of ASD, concerns have risen regarding a potential “lost generation” that may face difficulties in fulfilling its potential. Through this comprehensive review, we aim to provide an overview of innovative approaches that use XR technologies to improve the learning experience of individuals with ASD.
