> This paper presents a systematic review of the emerging applications of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and sensor-based technologies in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The integration of these technologies has led to promising advances in identifying unique behavioral, physiological, and neuroanatomical markers associated with ASD. Through an examination of recent studies, we explore how technologies such as wearable sensors, eye-tracking systems, virtual reality environments, neuroimaging, and microbiome analysis contribute to a holistic approach to ASD diagnostics. The analysis reveals how these technologies facilitate non-invasive, real-time assessments across diverse settings, enhancing both diagnostic accuracy and accessibility. The findings underscore the transformative potential of AI, IoT, and sensor-based driven tools in providing personalized and continuous ASD detection, advocating for data-driven approaches that extend beyond traditional methodologies. Ultimately, this review emphasizes the role of technology in improving ASD diagnostic processes, paving the way for targeted and individualized assessments.
