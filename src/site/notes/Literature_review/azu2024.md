> Clinician and caregiver reports of autism features are both integral to receiving an autism diagnosis and appropriate intervention, yet informant discrepancies are present in clinical practice and may differ by demographic characteristics of the child and family. The present study examined how clinician–caregiver discrepancies in ratings of a child’s autism-related behaviors relate to a child’s sex at birth, age at first diagnosis, and amount of intervention received. Participants were 280 children (76.8% male, 67.9% White), 6–11 years old (M = 8.5 ± 1.6), with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Variable-centered and person-centered approaches were used to examine relationships between standardized clinician–caregiver discrepancy and participant characteristics. Both analytic approaches indicated that clinicians rated autism-related behaviors lower than caregivers for females and higher than caregivers for males. In addition, lower clinician ratings of autism features, relative to caregiver ratings, were associated with older age at diagnosis and fewer hours of intervention. Findings underscore the importance of incorporating multiple informants, especially caregivers, in the diagnostic process and developing diagnostic procedures sensitive to the female autism phenotype to facilitate diagnosis, intervention, and subsequent development.
Lay abstract
In some cases, a clinician’s perceptions of a child’s autism-related behaviors are not the same as the child’s caregiver’s perceptions. Identifying how these discrepancies relate to the characteristics of the child is critical for ensuring that diagnosis procedures are unbiased and suitable for all children. This study examined whether discrepancies between clinician and caregiver reports of autism features related to the child’s sex at birth. We also explored how the discrepancies related to the age at which the child received their autism diagnosis and how much intervention they received. We found that clinicians rated autism features higher than caregivers for boys and rated autism features lower than caregivers for girls. In addition, lower clinician relative to parent ratings was related to being diagnosed at an older age and receiving less intervention. These findings suggest that there is more to learn about the presentation of autism-related behaviors in girls. When caregiver and clinician ratings of autism features do not align, it may be important to consider caregivers’ ratings to obtain a more accurate picture of the child’s autism features and the support they may need.
