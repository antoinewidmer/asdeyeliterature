## 📌 Summary


## 🔬 Methods 
### Participants


- **Total Sample:** 165 children
    
    - **ASD group:** 72 children (64 boys, 8 girls)
    - **Typically Developing (TD) group:** 93 children (50 boys, 43 girls)
- **Age range:** **2 to 13 years**
    
    - **Young age group:** **2-7 years old**
    - **Older age group:** **8-13 years old**
- **Clinical assessments used for ASD group:**
    
    - **Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)**
    - **Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)**
    - **Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)**

### Tasks for participants

- **Stimulus Presentation:**
    - **52-second sequence** of visual stimuli, alternating between **faces** and **objects**.
    - A **black and white screen** was included to measure the **pupil light reflex**.
    - **Face stimuli:** Neutral-expression faces of 2 men and 2 women.
    - **Object stimuli:** 4 toy objects.
    - **Luminance and size were controlled** to ensure fair comparisons.
    - **No explicit task** was given; children just watched the screen.

### System setup and hardware
**Eye-tracking device:** **FaceLAB® (60Hz sampling rate)**

- ### Data Analysis
- 
- **Eye-Tracking & Pupillometry Data Extraction**

1. **Oculometric Parameters:**
    - **Fixation duration:** Time spent looking at faces, eyes, mouth, and objects.
    - **Number of fixations:** How often a child fixates on different stimuli.
    - **Latency of first fixation:** Time taken to first look at a region.
    - **Total time tracked (TTT):** How long a child remained engaged.
    
2. **Pupillometric Parameters:**
    - **Pupil Light Reflex (PLR):** Pupil constriction/dilation in response to light.
    - **Pupil diameter variation (PDV):** Change in pupil size while viewing faces vs. objects.
    - **Pupil baseline (PBas):** Resting pupil size before stimulus presentation.

- ## 📊 Results & Key Findings 

- **Combining eye-tracking (oculometric) and pupil-based (pupillometric) features significantly improves ASD classification.**
- **Best discrimination was achieved in younger children (2-7 years old), with AUC > 0.9 in several models.**
- **Standalone features (eye-tracking or pupil-based) were not sufficient for high classification accuracy.**
- **Machine learning played a crucial role in identifying the most effective combinations of features.**
- **Future clinical applications could benefit from shorter, non-intrusive eye-tracking tests for early ASD screening.**
