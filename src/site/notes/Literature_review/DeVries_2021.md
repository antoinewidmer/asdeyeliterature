## üìå Summary

- Investigate whether **pupillary responses** differ between **ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals**.
- Conducted a **systematic literature review** and **meta-analysis** on existing studies.
- Used **quantitative (statistical) and qualitative (thematic) analyses** to evaluate findings.

## üî¨ Methods 
### Literature Review and Inclusion Criteria

- A **systematic search** was performed in **PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science**.
- Used keywords: **"autism," "ASD," "pupil," "pupil reflex," "pupillary light reflex."**
- **Inclusion criteria:**
    1. **Experimental design**
    2. **Human population**
    3. **Comparison between ASD and control group**
    4. **English language**
- **Excluded** non-experimental studies, reviews, case reports.

### Meta-Analysis Methods

- **Hedges‚Äô g effect size** was used due to **small sample sizes** in many studies.
    
- **Statistical tools:** _R 3.5.0_ and _Metafor package_.
    
- Used a **random-effects model** for multiple pupil characteristics:
    
    - **Baseline pupil size**
    - **Latency of pupil response**
    - **Amplitude of pupil constriction/dilation**
- **Risk of bias** was assessed using the **QUADAS-2 tool**, evaluating:
    
    1. **Patient selection**
    2. **Index test (pupillometry method)**
    3. **Reference standard**
    4. **Flow and timing of measurements**

- ### Data Analysis

- ## üìä Results & Key Findings 

### Meta-Analysis Results

1. **Latency of pupil response:**
    
    - **Significantly longer** in ASD individuals.
    - **Effect size: Hedges‚Äô g = 1.03 (p = 0.0008)** ‚Üí **large effect.**
    - Suggests **delayed signal transduction** in ASD.
2. **Baseline pupil size:**
    
    - **No significant group difference** between ASD and TD individuals.
    - Some studies reported larger baseline pupil size in ASD, but findings were inconsistent.
3. **Amplitude of pupil constriction/dilation:**
    
    - **Conflicting results**.
    - No significant overall group difference.

### Qualitative Analysis

- Used **Nvivo-12 software** for thematic coding of discussion sections in reviewed papers.
- **Key explanations** for pupillary differences in ASD:
    - **Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) Dysregulation**
        - Altered balance of **sympathetic vs. parasympathetic activity**.
        - **Locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system** involvement in arousal and attention.
    - **Sensory Processing Differences**
        - Hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory stimuli.
    - **Developmental Differences**
        - Pupillary response differences may emerge **early in life** and change with age.
    - **Cognitive Load and Attention**
        - Longer latency may reflect **altered attentional control and executive functioning**.
