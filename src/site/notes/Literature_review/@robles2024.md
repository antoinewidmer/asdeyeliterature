> Background/Objective
Autism has been investigated through traditional emotion recognition paradigms, merely investigating accuracy, thereby constraining how potential differences across autistic and control individuals may be observed, identified, and described. Moreover, the use of emotional facial expression information for social functioning in autism is of relevance to provide a deeper understanding of the condition.
Method
Adult autistic individuals (n = 34) and adult control individuals (n = 34) were assessed with a social perception behavioral paradigm exploring facial expression predictions and their impact on social evaluation.
Results
Autistic individuals held less stereotypical predictions than controls. Importantly, despite such differences in predictions, the use of such predictions for social evaluation did not differ significantly between groups, as autistic individuals relied on their predictions to evaluate others to the same extent as controls.
Conclusions
These results help to understand how autistic individuals perceive social stimuli and evaluate others, revealing a deviation from stereotypicality beyond which social evaluation strategies may be intact.
