> <sec><title>Objective</title><p>Sensory processing is the ability to capture, elaborate, and integrate information through the five senses and is impaired in over 90% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The ASD population shows hyper‚Äìhypo sensitiveness to sensory stimuli that can generate alteration in information processing, affecting cognitive and social responses to daily life situations. Structured and semi-structured interviews are generally used for ASD assessment, and the evaluation relies on the examiner‚Äôs subjectivity and expertise, which can lead to misleading outcomes. Recently, there has been a growing need for more objective, reliable, and valid diagnostic measures, such as biomarkers, to distinguish typical from atypical functioning and to reliably track the progression of the illness, helping to diagnose ASD. Implicit measures and ecological valid settings have been showing high accuracy on predicting outcomes and correctly classifying populations in categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two experiments investigated whether sensory processing can discriminate between ASD and typical development (TD) populations using electrodermal activity (EDA) in two multimodal virtual environments (VE): forest VE and city VE. In the first experiment, 24 children with ASD diagnosis and 30 TDs participated in both virtual experiences, and changes in EDA have been recorded before and during the presentation of visual, auditive, and olfactive stimuli. In the second experiment, 40 children have been added to test the model of experiment 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The first exploratory results on EDA comparison models showed that the integration of visual, auditive, and olfactive stimuli in the forest environment provided higher accuracy (90.3%) on sensory dysfunction discrimination than specific stimuli. In the second experiment, 92 subjects experienced the forest VE, and results on 72 subjects showed that stimuli integration achieved an accuracy of 83.33%. The final confirmatory test set (<italic>n</italic> = 20) achieved 85% accuracy, simulating a real application of the models. Further relevant result concerns the visual stimuli condition in the first experiment, which achieved 84.6% of accuracy in recognizing ASD sensory dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>According to our studies‚Äô results, implicit measures, such as EDA, and ecological valid settings can represent valid quantitative methods, along with traditional assessment measures, to classify ASD population, enhancing knowledge on the development of relevant specific treatments.</p></sec>

## üìå Summary

- The study explores the application of supervised machine learning to identify behavioral biomarkers of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using electrodermal activity (EDA) and virtual reality (VR).
- Sensory processing differences between ASD and typically developing (TD) children were assessed in virtual forest and city environments.
- EDA signals recorded during multimodal sensory stimulation (visual, auditory, and olfactory) were used to train machine learning models.
- The model achieved up to 90.3% accuracy in differentiating ASD from TD participants.
- The study supports using VR-based environments and physiological markers for more objective ASD diagnostics.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- Two-phase experimental design: exploratory (Experiment 1) and confirmatory (Experiment 2).
- Children participated in virtual reality environments while EDA was measured to differentiate sensory responses.

### Participants

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age (Mean ¬± SD)|Diagnosis|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ASD|29|26/3|5.20 ¬± 1.34|DSM/ICD-based clinical diagnosis|
|TD|23|13/10|4.87 ¬± 0.92|Neurotypical|

### Tasks for Participants

Participants completed tasks involving greeting responses and imitation of avatars in virtual environments with varying sensory stimuli.

|Task|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|
|Greeting Interaction|Assess social response to greetings|Virtual forest environment|EDA, behavioral response|
|Avatar Imitation|Evaluate imitation behaviors|Virtual city environment|EDA, imitation accuracy|

### System Setup and Hardware

|Device|Purpose|Specifications|
|---|---|---|
|Empatica E4 Wristband|EDA measurement|4 Hz sampling|
|CAVE VR System|Immersive VR environment|3-wall projection|
|Olorama Technology|Olfactory stimuli|Wireless scent dispenser|
|Logitech Z906|Audio delivery|5.1 surround sound|

### Data Analysis

|Feature|Task|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Baseline tonic EDA|All tasks|Skin conductance level before stimuli|
|Phasic EDA response|All tasks|Short-term EDA response to stimuli|
|EDA ratio (tonic/phasic)|All tasks|Ratio of baseline to response EDA|
|Stimuli modality response|Test trials|EDA differences by sensory modality|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings

- The forest environment with combined visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli yielded 90.3% accuracy in ASD detection.
- Visual-only stimuli achieved 84.6% accuracy, suggesting visual sensitivity in ASD.
- The city environment yielded lower accuracy (70.5%), indicating task-dependent variability.
- Phasic EDA responses were more relevant for ASD detection than tonic components.

### Implications

- VR combined with physiological biomarkers can provide objective measures for ASD assessment.
- Multimodal stimuli in naturalistic environments improve classification accuracy.
- Phasic EDA responses may reflect sensory hyper-responsiveness in ASD.

## üîç Related Work

- Aligns with prior research on sensory dysfunction in ASD.
- Extends findings by using multimodal VR and machine learning for ASD detection.
- Highlights potential for integrating VR tools in clinical assessments.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- Use of immersive VR for ecologically valid assessment.
- Integration of multiple sensory modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
- High classification performance with a simple wearable device (Empatica E4).

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Small sample size with limited gender diversity in the ASD group.
- No investigation of potential confounding variables (e.g., cognitive ability or sensory sensitivities).
- VR novelty effect might have influenced the results.
- Lack of longitudinal data to assess biomarker stability.
- Limited generalizability due to age range and task specificity.

The study supports using EDA and VR-based environments as potential diagnostic tools for ASD but requires larger and more diverse participant samples for broader applicability.
