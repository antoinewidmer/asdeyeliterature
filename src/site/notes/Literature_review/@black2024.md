> Introduction Advancing research and support for neurologically diverse populations requires novel data harmonisation methods that are capable of aligning with contemporary approaches to understanding health and disability.
Objectives We present the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a conceptual framework to support harmonisation of mental health data and present a proof of principle within the Risk and Resilience in Developmental Diversity and Mental Health (R2D2-MH) consortium.
Method 138 measures from various mental health datasets were linked to the ICF following the WHO‚Äôs established linking rules.
Findings Findings support the notion that the ICF can assist in the harmonisation of mental health data. The high level of shared ICF codes provides indications of where items may be readily harmonised to develop datasets that may align more readily with contemporary approaches to understanding health and disability. Although the linking process necessarily entails an element of subjectivity, the application of established rules can increase rigour and transparency of the harmonisation process.
Conclusions We present the first steps towards data harmonisation in mental health that is compatible with contemporary approaches in psychiatry, being more capable of capturing diversity and aligning with more transdiagnostic and neurodiversity-affirmative ways of understanding data.
Clinical implications Our findings show promise, but future work is needed to address quantitative harmonisation. Similarly, issues related to the traditionally ‚Äòpathophysiological‚Äô frameworks that existing datasets are often embedded in can hinder the full potential of harmonisation based on the ICF.

## üìå Summary

- The study presents the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a conceptual framework for harmonising mental health data.
- The ICF is used to align diverse psychiatric data with contemporary paradigms such as transdiagnostic, neurodiversity, and positive psychology approaches.
- The study provides a proof of principle using the Risk and Resilience in Developmental Diversity and Mental Health (R2D2-MH) consortium.
- 138 mental health measures from various datasets were linked to the ICF to improve data comparability.
- The study highlights the potential of ICF-based harmonisation for creating more inclusive and holistic mental health datasets.

## üèõ Rationale

- The growing interest in retrospectively harmonising mental health data requires structured frameworks that align with contemporary psychiatric paradigms.
- Traditional psychiatric research is often siloed into diagnostic categories, limiting cross-study comparability and integration.
- The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a comprehensive and inclusive approach to understanding mental health beyond diagnostic labels.
- By adopting ICF as a framework, researchers can better capture the interplay between biological, psychological, and environmental factors in mental health conditions.
- The study aims to demonstrate how the ICF framework can facilitate large-scale data integration in a way that aligns with transdiagnostic, neurodiversity-affirmative, and positive psychology approaches.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- Retrospective data harmonisation aligning psychiatric datasets with the ICF framework.
- Linking of mental health measures using WHO‚Äôs ICF linking rules.

### Data Sources

- Mental health data from the R2D2-MH consortium.
- Datasets included cohorts with autism, ADHD, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and other neurodevelopmental conditions.

### Linking Procedure

- 138 mental health measures were linked to ICF categories.
- Manual review and assignment of ICF codes to mental health assessment tools.
- Evaluation of inter-rater agreement to ensure consistency in linking.

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings

- ICF provides a structured approach to harmonising psychiatric data across multiple domains.
- Data mapping revealed significant overlaps across different mental health measures.
- The study demonstrates how transdiagnostic and neurodiversity-affirmative approaches can be integrated into data harmonisation.
- Environmental factors were underrepresented in existing datasets, highlighting a need for broader data collection approaches.

### Implications

- ICF-based harmonisation aligns with contemporary mental health paradigms.
- Future research should incorporate environmental and social determinants of mental health to enhance the utility of harmonised datasets.
- The methodology supports a more nuanced understanding of psychiatric conditions beyond traditional diagnostic labels.

## üîç Related Work

- Builds on previous psychiatric research advocating for transdiagnostic approaches.
- Expands the use of the ICF framework in psychiatric data analysis.
- Aligns with research promoting strengths-based assessments in neurodiversity.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- Demonstrates the feasibility of ICF-based data harmonisation in mental health.
- Introduces a structured and replicable methodology for integrating diverse psychiatric datasets.
- Provides a conceptual framework that can be extended to other mental health research initiatives.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Existing datasets may lack sufficient coverage of environmental and social factors.
- The harmonisation process is subject to subjective interpretation, requiring further validation.
- ICF lacks specificity in capturing certain psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions.
- More research is needed to develop quantitative harmonisation techniques beyond conceptual mapping.

This study presents a foundational approach to harmonising mental health data using the ICF, with potential applications for more inclusive and holistic psychiatric research frameworks.
