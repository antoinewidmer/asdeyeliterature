> In this study, the researchers explored the usage of a virtual reality (VR)–based social skills learning environment for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using OpenSimulator, the researchers constructed a desktop VR-based learning environment that supports social-oriented role-play, gaming, and design by children with ASD. Seven 10–14 years old children with ASD participated in this VR-based social skills program for 20+ hr on average. Data were collected via screen recording and observation of play- and design-oriented social skills enactment and pre- and postintervention Social Communication and Skills Questionnaires. Participants demonstrated an increased level of successful social skills performance from the baseline to the intervention phase. The findings provided preliminary evidence for the usage of a VR-based social skills learning environment for children with ASD.
