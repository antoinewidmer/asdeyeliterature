> The integration of prior expectations, sensory information, and environmental volatility is proposed to be atypical in Autism Spectrum Disorder, yet few studies have tested these predictive processes in active movement tasks. To address this gap in the research, we used an immersive virtual-reality racquetball paradigm to explore how visual sampling behaviours and movement kinematics are adjusted in relation to unexpected, uncertain, and volatile changes in environmental statistics. We found that prior expectations concerning ball ‚Äòbounciness‚Äô affected sensorimotor control in both autistic and neurotypical participants, with all individuals using prediction-driven gaze strategies to track the virtual ball. However, autistic participants showed substantial differences in visuomotor behaviour when environmental conditions were more volatile. Specifically, uncertainty-related performance difficulties in these conditions were accompanied by atypical movement kinematics and visual sampling responses. Results support proposals that autistic people overestimate the volatility of sensory environments, and suggest that context-sensitive differences in active inference could explain a range of movement-related difficulties in autism.

## üìå Summary

- The study investigates active inference differences in autistic and neurotypical adults using immersive virtual reality.
- A VR racquetball task was used to examine visual sampling behaviors and movement kinematics under different environmental volatility conditions.
- Autistic participants showed altered movement kinematics and visual sampling behaviors under volatile conditions.
- Results support the hypothesis that autistic individuals overestimate environmental volatility.
- Findings suggest that predictive processing differences in autism may contribute to motor control difficulties.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- Experimental study using a virtual racquetball task to assess sensorimotor control.
- Visual sampling and movement kinematics were analyzed across stable and volatile conditions.

### Participants

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age (Mean ¬± SD)|Diagnosis|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Autistic|26|Not specified|21.40 ¬± 5.09|Clinical ASD diagnosis (DSM/ICD)|
|Neurotypical|54|Not specified|21.78 ¬± 4.14|No developmental disorders|

### Tasks for Participants

Participants performed a virtual racquetball task requiring interception of balls under varying conditions.

|Task|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|
|Stable Condition|Assess response under predictable cues|VR racquetball|Gaze data, kinematics, accuracy|
|Volatile Condition|Assess response under uncertain cues|VR racquetball|Gaze data, kinematics, accuracy|

### System Setup and Hardware

|Device|Purpose|Specifications|
|---|---|---|
|HTC Vive HMD|VR environment display|110¬∞ FOV, 90 Hz, 1440x1600 px/eye|
|Tobii Eye Tracker|Track gaze behavior|120 Hz sampling, 0.5¬∞ accuracy|
|VR Hand Controller|Record movement kinematics|90 Hz sampling|
|Unity Software|VR environment development|Custom racquetball environment|

### Data Analysis

|Feature|Task|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Interception Rate|Both conditions|Success rate of ball interception|
|Swing Kinematics|Both conditions|Swing onset, peak velocity, ROM|
|Gaze Fixation Duration|Both conditions|Duration of fixation around ball bounce|
|Pre-bounce Saccade Timing|Both conditions|Timing and amplitude of anticipatory saccades|
|Gaze Tracking Error|Test trials|Angular distance between gaze and ball post-bounce|
|UE-E Gaze Tracking Difference|Test trials|Behavioral surprise in response to unexpected bounces|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings

- Autistic participants exhibited lower interception rates, particularly under volatile conditions.
- Autistic participants showed slower hand movements and reduced range of motion.
- Predictive gaze behavior was observed across both groups, but autistic participants had less variability.
- Eye-tracking data indicated reduced behavioral surprise to unexpected events in autistic individuals.

### Implications

- Autistic individuals may overestimate environmental volatility, leading to motor control difficulties.
- Findings align with active inference models predicting sensory integration differences in autism.
- Insights could inform motor skill interventions using adaptive VR tasks.

## üîç Related Work

- Aligns with prior research on motor control and predictive processing differences in ASD.
- Extends findings by examining context-sensitive volatility processing in VR environments.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- Innovative use of immersive VR to examine sensorimotor behaviors.
- Direct manipulation of environmental volatility enhances experimental control.
- Comprehensive dataset combining gaze and motion metrics.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Small sample size, particularly for the autistic group.
- Lack of gender-specific analysis limits insight into sex differences.
- Absence of longitudinal data to assess task learning over time.
- Potential ecological validity concerns due to VR simulation context.
- Eye-tracking accuracy may be reduced by headset movement.

The study demonstrates altered predictive processing in autism but requires further research to validate findings in real-world contexts.
