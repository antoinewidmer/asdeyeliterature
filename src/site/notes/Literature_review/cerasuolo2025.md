> While studies examining the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) systems in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) intervention have seen significant growth, research on their application as tools to improve assessment and diagnosis remains limited. This systematic review explores the potential of VR systems in speeding-up and enhancing the assessment process for ASD.

## üìñ Summary

- **Objective/Purpose:**
    - Investigate the potential of virtual reality (VR) systems to enhance diagnostic assessment for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
    - Examine how VR technologies can boost ASD traits that might be missed with traditional diagnostic tools.
- **Scope of the Review:**
    - Systematic review of 20 peer-reviewed studies focusing on ASD assessment using VR.
    - Explores communication, social interaction, cognitive functioning, sensory processing, and motor behavior.
- **Key Inclusion Criteria:**
    - Studies including participants with clinically diagnosed ASD.
    - Comparative analysis between ASD and typically developing (TD) participants.
    - Published in the last 10 years, written in English, with primary research data.
- **Key Exclusion Criteria:**
    - Studies focused solely on intervention or rehabilitation.
    - Reviews, meta-analyses, protocols, and studies without full-text access.

|**Category**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Review Type**|Systematic Review|
|**Number of Studies**|20|
|**Study Focus**|ASD assessment using VR|
|**Key Domains**|Communication, cognition, sensory processing, motor behavior|

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Selection & Data Sources

- **Databases searched:** PubMed, IEEE Xplore.
- **Keywords used:** ("autism" OR "autistic") AND ("virtual reality" OR "augmented reality") AND ("diagnosis OR assessment").
- **Screening process:**
    - Titles and abstracts screened by two independent reviewers.
    - Discrepancies resolved by consensus.
- **Final inclusion:** 20 studies.

### Data Extraction & Quality Assessment

- **Data Extractors:** Two independent reviewers.
- **Tools Used:** Rayyan software.
- **Bias Assessment:** Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

### Meta-Analysis Methods

- Statistical approaches included descriptive and comparative analysis.
- Heterogeneity evaluated using I¬≤ statistic.
- Machine learning techniques applied to eye gaze and motor behavior data.

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Overview of Included Studies

|**Aspect**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Number of Studies**|20|
|**Sample Size Range**|6 to 92 participants|
|**Study Designs**|Cross-sectional, case-control, observational|
|**Geographical Distribution**|Primarily Europe and North America|

### Main Findings

- **VR boosts ASD traits**: ASD participants displayed distinct patterns in gaze behavior, social interaction, and motor function.
    
- **Eye tracking metrics**: ASD individuals spent less time looking at socially relevant areas.
    
- **Motor behavior differences**: Greater variability and reduced motor control in ASD participants.
    
- **Machine learning potential**: High accuracy in ASD classification using gaze and motor data.
    
- **Heterogeneity & Publication Bias:**
    
    - High methodological variability across studies.
    - No strong evidence of publication bias identified.

## üîç Related Work & Theoretical Framework

- **Previous Reviews:** Most prior studies focused on VR interventions rather than diagnostic applications.
- **Theoretical Frameworks:** Utilized cognitive and motor behavior theories, especially for gaze behavior analysis.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

‚úÖ **Novel Application:** Highlights the potential of VR for ASD diagnosis rather than just intervention.  
‚úÖ **Methodological Rigor:** Systematic approach with clear inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
‚úÖ **Innovative Insights:** Reveals behavioral markers in ASD that are less observable in traditional settings.  
‚úÖ **Machine Learning Integration:** Demonstrates the value of computational methods in diagnostic refinement.

### Major Concerns & Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Sample Size:** Most studies included small sample sizes.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Study Variability:** Differences in VR setups and metrics limit cross-study comparability.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Age Range Restrictions:** Few studies included very young or older populations.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Ecological Validity:** Uncertain generalizability from VR to real-world settings.

## üöÄ Conclusion & Future Directions

- **Clinical Implications:** VR systems can serve as objective tools to supplement traditional ASD diagnostic methods.
- **Research Recommendations:**
    - Increase sample sizes.
    - Standardize VR protocols across studies.
    - Further explore motor and gaze-based biomarkers.
