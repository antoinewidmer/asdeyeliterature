## üìñ Summary

### **Objective/Purpose**

- The study examines digital phenotyping tools, particularly SensetoKnow, to improve autism spectrum disorder (ASD) detection.
- It explores the strengths and limitations of using computer vision and machine learning to analyze autism-related behaviors in toddlers.
- The article highlights key challenges in reliability, accuracy across diverse populations, and clinical integration.

### **Suggested Improvements**

|Area of Improvement|Description|
|---|---|
|**Reliability & Consistency**|Digital tools must produce stable results within short periods for individual children.|
|**Diverse Population Validation**|Studies should ensure effectiveness across race, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds.|
|**Reducing False Positives**|High rates of false positives (especially in younger children) must be minimized to prevent overdiagnosis.|
|**Clinical Interpretability**|Physicians need clear guidance on interpreting and communicating digital phenotyping results.|
|**Integration with Existing Screening**|Combining SensetoKnow with M-CHAT or other validated tools can improve diagnostic accuracy.|
|**Understanding Developmental Delays**|Further research should distinguish between ASD-specific markers and general developmental delays.|
|**Implementation Studies**|Studies on how primary care providers use and act upon digital screening results are essential.|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### **Strengths of Digital Phenotyping for ASD**

|Strength|Description|
|---|---|
|**Objective & Scalable**|Allows for non-subjective ASD screening, reducing reliance on clinician observation alone.|

> ‚ÄúMost striking is that although the sensitivity and specificity of the tool were good, the positive predictive values ‚Äì that is, the proportion of children who screened positive with the tool who were true positives ‚Äì ranged from less than 13% for the youngest toddlers to 40% for 24- to 36-month-old children. This means that more than twice as many children who did not have ASD were identified as positive than children who actually did have ASD‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=1&annotation=9FQ45PA3)

> ‚Äúanother digital phenotyping measure of ASD, a tool known as GeoPref (which takes just one minute), found opposite results, with very high specificity but poor sensitivity4.‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=2&annotation=45EIIFXQ)

> ‚ÄúThe implications for a primary care physician who must interpret and deliver such results are daunting. Not only are there concerns about how this affects families whose children are misidentified as having ASD, but it also seems likely that such experiences would affect physicians‚Äô use of such devices.‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=2&annotation=23U9NXZF)

> ‚ÄúSimilar issues have arisen with other ASD-screening strategies; when potential ASD was indicated in early screening (at the 1-year well-child visit), many physicians did not follow up on this information even when referral services were offered5.  A second major conce‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=2&annotation=JTTZFI2Y)

> ‚ÄúA second major conce‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=2&annotation=IESSRJES)

> ‚Äúnot unique to SensetoKnow, but a general issue with digital phenotyping ‚Äì is that the accuracy of the device across race, gender and age is not clear6.‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=2&annotation=UAB8K3L4)

> ‚ÄúThere were no statistically significant effects of race or sex or age, but when the data are perused closely, girls, Black children and young toddlers were overidentified as potentially having ASD at high rates. The children with ASD were, on average, significantly developmentally delayed, particularly in receptive language, and even more delayed than the non-autistic delayed group. Thus, it is possible that what was identified (when SensetoKnow worked accurately) was general delay or even limited receptive language.‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=2&annotation=ULS5PDVG)

> ‚Äúthe quality of the score (that is, the rating of data acquisition) was reported and appeared to have an effect on the specificity of the results (again resulting in overdiagnoses in the small number of lower-quality results). More information will be needed to guide healthcare providers in what this means.‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=2&annotation=V2V7UBSV)

> ‚ÄúAnother strength of the study is that data are presented about the increased sensitivity and specificity (but not about positive predictive values) of combining the SensetoKnow results with information from M-CHAT, a parent report measure7.‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=2&annotation=EI4DL5GN)

> ‚ÄúRecognition of early ASD symptoms and appropriate evaluation and diagnosis are often significantly delayed by stigma and socioeconomic, racial and ethnic disparities. Another cause of delays is lack of access to higher-level practice providers, such as child neurologists, child psychiatrists and psychologists, and developmental behavioral pediatricians, who can confirm a diagnosis and work with families to determine appropriate intervention strategies. Many autistic children have issues with attention and cognition, motor skills and language.‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=2&annotation=VHD2VL2Y)

> ‚ÄúGiven that there is no single treatment for all autistic children, even with accurate early identification of ASD, there will always be a need to support families in the long term as they seek personalized intervention programs that may vary from intense multi-disciplinary interventions to supported placement in ordinary preschool programs and other specific therapies, based on individual needs8.‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=2&annotation=T5RPNF3Q)

> ‚ÄúASD diagnoses are intended to be based on observations and on information from caregivers about a set of behaviors relating to social communication and restricted, repetitive or sensory behaviors10.‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=3&annotation=USMX4KC7)

> ‚ÄúA contribution of SensetoKnow to clinical practice, once reliability is established, would be to provide primary care practitioners a way to bring potential issues to caregivers‚Äô attention to help increase awareness, if this could be done without causing undo alarm.‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=3&annotation=CDNQSLIS)

> ‚ÄúResearchers have focused on early detection of ASD, but future applications of digital phenotyping tools could focus on identifying and monitoring factors that contribute to ASD, such as limited social interactions, or those that co-occur with ASD, such as motor difficulties or general developmental delays12. Practitioners may benefit from this information, which might give an accurate representation of observations at the individual level while also reflecting the broad heterogeneity of developmental disabilities.‚Äù Yellow Highlight [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S26BZABH?page=3&annotation=7PJ2GIHW)
