|                                                       |                                                  | PLR Amplitude (%)                            |     |
| **4. Resting State Fixation**                         | Measure baseline gaze behavior.                  | Fixation Duration (ms)                       |     |
|                                                       |                                                  | Saccade Amplitude                            |     |
| **5. Passive Visual Exploration**                     | Assess natural gaze exploration of a scene.      | Fixation Duration (ms)                       |     |
|                                                       |                                                  | Saccade Duration                             |     |

#### Eye-Tracking Biomarkers & Autism Diagnosis

Six eye-tracking measures **differentiated ASD from non-ASD children**.

|**Biomarker**|**ASD Group (Mean ± SD)**|**Non-ASD Group (Mean ± SD)**|**p-value**|**AUC Score**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Nonsocial Preference (%)**|46.2 ± 22.3|21.5 ± 12.4|**p < .001**|**0.82**|
|**No-Shift (Gap-Overlap, % Failure to Disengage)**|8.65 ± 13.42|0.83 ± 10.45|**p = .02**|**0.72**|
|**Resting Fixation Duration (ms)**|527.8 ± 135.7|460.9 ± 110.4|**p = .01**|**0.63**|
|**PLR Latency (ms)**|268.5 ± 25.9|291.4 ± 23.6|**p = .008**|**0.75**|
|**PLR Amplitude (%)**|32.7 ± 10.3|24.7 ± 8.2|**p = .02**|**0.72**|
|**Exploration Fixation Duration (ms)**|344.6 ± 63.1|320.8 ± 42.1|**p = .03**|**0.61**|

- **Nonsocial Preference (46% vs. 21%) was the strongest biomarker (AUC = 0.82).**
- **Pupillary Light Reflex (PLR) latency and amplitude also differentiated ASD (AUC ~0.75).**
- **Attentional disengagement and fixation duration had moderate predictive value.**

#### Diagnostic Accuracy of Eye-Tracking Alone vs. Integrated Approach

|**Diagnostic Method**|**Sensitivity (%)**|**Specificity (%)**|**AUC Score**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Eye-Tracking Biomarker Alone**|**77.5%**|**77.3%**|**0.78**|
|**PCP Diagnosis Alone**|**83.3%**|**70.3%**|**0.82**|
|**PCP + Eye-Tracking Biomarkers**|**90.7%**|**86.7%**|**0.92**|

- **Eye-tracking alone had moderate accuracy (78% sensitivity, 77% specificity).**
- **PCP diagnosis alone was slightly better (83% sensitivity, but lower specificity).**
- **Combining PCP + Eye-Tracking Biomarkers achieved the highest accuracy (91% sensitivity, 87% specificity, AUC = 0.92).**

#### Clinical Implications

- **PCPs with access to eye-tracking biomarkers made fewer false-negative diagnoses.**
- **Eye-tracking improved diagnostic certainty, especially in borderline cases.**
- **Findings support using eye-tracking as a scalable early-screening tool for ASD.**
