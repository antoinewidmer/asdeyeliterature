> Purpose: Telemedicine approaches to autism (ASD) assessment have become increasingly common, yet few validated tools exist for this purpose. This study presents results from a clinical trial investigating two approaches to tele-assessment for ASD in toddlers. Methods: 144 children (29% female) between 17 and 36 months of age (mean = 2.5 years, SD = 0.33 years) completed tele-assessment using either the TELE-ASD-PEDS (TAP) or an experimental remote administration of the Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers (STAT). All children then completed traditional in-person assessment with a blinded clinician, using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 3rd Edition (VABS-3), and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2). Both tele-assessment and in-person assessment included a clinical interview with caregivers. Results: Results indicated diagnostic agreement for 92% of participants. Children diagnosed with ASD following in-person assessment who were missed by tele-assessment (n = 8) had lower scores on tele- and in-person ASD assessment tools. Children inaccurately identified as having ASD by tele-assessment (n = 3) were younger than other children and had higher developmental and adaptive behavior scores than children accurately diagnosed with ASD by tele-assessment. Diagnostic certainty was highest for children correctly identified as having ASD via tele-assessment. Clinicians and caregivers reported satisfaction with tele-assessment procedures. Conclusion: This work provides additional support for the use of tele-assessment for identification of ASD in toddlers, with both clinicians and families reporting broad acceptability. Continued development and refinement of tele-assessment procedures is recommended to optimize this approach for the needs of varying clinicians, families, and circumstances.
