> Objectives
To examine the impact of a new approach, Get SET Early, on the rates of early autism spectrum disorder (ASD) detection and factors that influence the screen-evaluate-treat chain.
Study design
After attending Get SET Early training, 203 pediatricians administered 57 603 total screens using the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Infant-Toddler Checklist at 12-, 18-, and 24-month well-baby examinations, and parents designated presence or absence of concern. For screen-positive toddlers, pediatricians specified if the child was being referred for evaluation, and if not, why not.
Results
Collapsed across ages, toddlers were evaluated and referred for treatment at a median age of 19¬†months, and those screened at 12¬†months (59.4% of sample) by 15¬†months. Pediatricians referred one-third of screen-positive toddlers for evaluation, citing lack of confidence in the accuracy of screen-positive results as the primary reason for nonreferral. If a parent expressed concerns, referral probability doubled, and the rate of an ASD diagnosis increased by 37%. Of 897 toddlers evaluated, almost one-half were diagnosed as ASD, translating into an ASD prevalence of 1%.
Conclusions
The Get SET Early model was effective at detecting ASD and initiating very early treatment. Results also underscored the need for change in early identification approaches to formally operationalize and incorporate pediatrician judgment and level of parent concern into the process.

## üìå Summary

- The **Get SET Early** model was developed to improve early detection and referral for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
- The study involved **203 pediatricians** who conducted **57,603 screenings** using the **Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales (CSBS) Infant-Toddler Checklist**.
- Screening occurred at **12, 18, and 24 months** during well-baby checkups.
- Pediatricians referred only **one-third of screen-positive toddlers**, often citing a lack of confidence in the screening tool.
- If parents **expressed concerns**, the likelihood of referral **doubled**, and the probability of an **ASD diagnosis increased by 37%**.
- **897 toddlers** underwent further evaluation, with **approximately half diagnosed with ASD**, yielding a **1% ASD prevalence** in the screened cohort.
- The model improved **early referral and treatment**, with most referred toddlers beginning treatment by **15-19 months**.

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### **Key Findings**

- **Early Screening Works:** **59.4% of toddlers** were screened by **12 months**, allowing diagnosis as early as **15 months**.
- **Parental Concern is Crucial:** The probability of referral **doubled** if parents expressed concern.
- **Pediatrician Skepticism:** **51% of non-referrals** occurred because pediatricians doubted the screening result.
- **ASD Prevalence:** **1% of the screened population** was diagnosed with ASD.
- **Treatment Began Early:** Median age of treatment initiation was **21 months**, much earlier than the **national average of 4 years**.

---

### **Implications for the Project**

- The **success of digital screening tools** like the CSBS Checklist suggests **automated, AI-based screening approaches** could further enhance early ASD detection.
- The study highlights the **barriers posed by pediatrician hesitation**, emphasizing the **need for improved clinician training and AI-assisted decision-making**.
- The **integration of parent input** into screening tools is critical‚Äîfuture models should incorporate **parental concerns as weighted factors**.
- **Multi-modal diagnostic approaches**, including **eye-tracking or neurophysiological markers**, could **increase sensitivity** where parent-report screening fails.

---

## üîç Related Work

- The study builds on previous work showing that **early intervention improves cognitive and social outcomes** for children with ASD.
- The **CSBS Checklist** has been validated in prior research but has known **sensitivity limitations**, supporting the **need for additional screening layers** (e.g., behavioral AI tools).
- The findings align with work showing **pediatricians often delay referrals** due to **uncertainty about early symptoms**, reinforcing the importance of **clinician education and automated screening assistance**.

---

## üìù Observations

### **Strengths of the Study**

- **Largest study to date** on real-world ASD screening across multiple pediatric clinics.
- **Demonstrates feasibility** of large-scale **digital screening tools** in real-world settings.
- **Empirical analysis** of **pediatrician decision-making** in ASD referral, shedding light on biases.
- **Strong demographic diversity**, including children from **low-income** and **ethnically diverse** backgrounds.

---

### **Major Concerns and Challenges**

1. **Pediatrician Hesitation Delays Diagnosis**
    
    - **Over 50% of failed screenings were not referred** due to pediatrician skepticism.
    - **Possible solution:** Introduce AI-powered clinical decision-support systems that **override pediatrician bias** when high-risk markers are detected.
2. **Screening Tool Sensitivity Issues**
    
    - **22% of toddlers with ASD** **initially passed the screen**, leading to delayed identification.
    - **Potential fix:** **Multi-modal screening**, integrating **behavioral AI, eye-tracking, and neurophysiological markers**.
3. **Parent Concern Drives Referral, But Some Parents May Not Express Concerns**
    
    - **Parents of younger children (12 months) were less likely to report concerns**, affecting referrals.
    - **Solution:** Enhance parent education and **integrate passive monitoring tools** (e.g., **home-based movement tracking**).
4. **No Long-Term Follow-Up on Treatment Outcomes**
    
    - While the study **tracked treatment engagement**, it **did not measure treatment efficacy** over multiple years.
    - **Future direction:** Implement **longitudinal tracking** to assess if **early detection leads to better functional outcomes**.

## Final Thoughts

This study underscores the **urgent need for enhanced ASD screening methods** and **multi-modal diagnostic tools**. While **digital screening** shows promise, reliance on **pediatrician judgment and parent concern** remains a **bottleneck**. The integration of **AI, behavioral analytics, and objective biomarkers** (e.g., **eye-tracking**) could revolutionize **early ASD detection** and **mitigate diagnostic delays**.
