> [!Abstract]
>
> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with more males than females diagnosed, and researchers have considered whether the existence of a female-specific ASD phenotype may contribute to differences in rates of diagnosis. We sought to inform this issue through a systematic review and meta-analysis of potential sex differences specifically in young autistic children across a range of domains including core ASD features, social functioning, cognition, and co-occurring internalising and/or externalising conditions. The systematic review identified 35 studies examining sex differences in young autistic children. Conflicting results were evident across studies, with some reporting small sex differences and others reporting no sex differences. Meta-analysis revealed no overarching significant sex differences in the domains investigated. However, the meta-analytic effect for the RRB domain approached significance, with females demonstrating fewer RRBs than males. Many of the primary studies included here utilised data from standardised diagnostic instruments to measure autism features, so while this study suggests non-significant sex differences in early childhood ASD, it remains possible that current tools are insufficiently sensitive to detect differences in ASD presentation by sex at this age. It is also possible that the diagnostic criteria may reflect a predominately ‚Äòmale phenotype‚Äô and this may obscure the detection of genuine sex differences in young autistic children.

# üìñ Summary

## Objective/Purpose:

The main goal of this review/meta-analysis is to examine potential sex differences in young autistic children across core ASD features, social functioning, cognitive development, and co-occurring internalizing and externalizing conditions. It aims to clarify whether a female-specific ASD phenotype exists that might contribute to sex-based disparities in diagnosis.

## Scope of the Review:

- The review focuses on children aged 1 to 6 years old.
- It includes core ASD features, social functioning, cognitive abilities, and co-occurring mental health conditions.
- The study is a systematic review and meta-analysis.

## Key Inclusion Criteria:

- Studies that explicitly compare male and female autistic children.
- Participants aged 1 to 6 years.
- Studies measuring core ASD features, social functioning, cognitive development, or co-occurring conditions.

## Key Exclusion Criteria:

- Studies without age-specific results.
- Non-peer-reviewed studies.
- Studies involving co-occurring medical syndromes (e.g., Fragile X).
- Animal model studies.

|**Inclusion**|**Exclusion**|

# üî¨ Methods

## Study Selection & Data Sources:

# üìä Results & Key Findings

## Overview of Included Studies:

|**Metric**|**Value**|
|---|---|
|Number of studies|35 (21 in meta-analysis)|
|Sample size|11,996 total (8794 males, 3202 females)|
|Study designs|Cross-sectional, longitudinal, cohort studies|
|Geographical distribution|Global, including US, Europe, and Asia|

## Main Findings:

- No significant sex differences in core ASD features, social functioning, cognitive abilities, or co-occurring conditions.
- Potential sex differences in restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) with males showing more RRBs.
- No significant differences in cognitive development.


- The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that sex differences in young autistic children are minimal and generally non-significant across core ASD features, social functioning, cognitive development, and co-occurring conditions. The notable exception is a near-significant difference in RRBs, with males showing more pronounced behaviors.

### Possible Explanations for Null Results:

#### Phenotypic Similarity:

- No genuine differences exist, and ASD manifests similarly in males and females during early childhood.

#### Diagnostic Tool Limitations:

- Standardized diagnostic tools may be male-biased, missing subtle female-specific traits.

#### Population Sampling Bias:

- Studies often include fewer females, potentially excluding those with subtler presentations.

#### Implications:

- Early diagnostic assessments may need adjustments to capture potential female phenotypes better.

Clinicians should remain cautious of sex-based assumptions during diagnosis.

#### Future Research:

- Develop tools sensitive to potential female phenotypes.

- Investigate how cognitive abilities might interact with sex differences in ASD features.

- Explore longitudinal changes that may reveal sex differences emerging over time.



### Heterogeneity & Publication Bias:

- Moderate heterogeneity found in social interaction and communication domains.
- No significant publication bias detected except for reciprocal social interaction.

# üîç Related Work & Theoretical Framework

- Consistent with Van Wijngaarden-Cremers et al. (2014) showing no significant sex differences.
- Aligns with Lai et al. (2015) indicating males may show more RRBs.
- The female autism phenotype remains a hypothesis; diagnostic tools may not capture subtle differences.

# üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- ‚úÖ Large sample size (11,996 participants).
- ‚úÖ Systematic and meta-analytic approach.
- ‚úÖ Inclusion of cognitive development and co-occurring conditions.

### Major Concerns & Limitations

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited data on late-diagnosed females.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate heterogeneity in social interaction.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential underrepresentation of autistic females with subtler phenotypes.

# üöÄ Conclusion & Future Directions

- The study suggests no significant early childhood sex differences in ASD phenotypes.
- Future research should explore differences using alternative diagnostic tools and age-specific analyses.
- Investigate late-diagnosed females to identify potential female-specific phenotypes.
