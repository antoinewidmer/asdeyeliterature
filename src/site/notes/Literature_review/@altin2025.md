>
> Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by limitations in social communication and interaction, self-repetitive behaviors, and the presence of limited interests. The prevalence of ASD, which typically emerges in the first years of life, is increasing at an alarming rate due to multiple factors, including the broadening of diagnostic criteria, heightened public awareness, and more frequent diagnoses among women and adults. Over the years, experts have invested considerable time and effort in developing educational scenarios for children with ASD. However, they have faced challenges replicating certain scenarios‚Äîsuch as emergencies, crowded public transportation, or restaurant environments‚Äîbecause recreating these exact conditions in real-world settings is difficult or cost-prohibitive. This has consequently compelled experts to seek out supplementary intervention methods that are more suitable and accessible. Virtual reality (VR), which has the capacity to integrate the physical and virtual realms, represents one such alternative intervention method. In this study, a systematic review of studies employing VR technology in social skills interventions for individuals with ASD was conducted, and 31 studies were included. The findings indicate the potential benefits of VR applications focusing on the social skills of individuals with ASD. Additionally, this research elucidates the limitations of the studies and offers suggestions for future research.

## üìñ Summary

### Objective/Purpose

- The primary goal of this systematic review is to analyze the use of **Virtual Reality (VR) interventions** in enhancing **social skills** among children with **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**.
- Research questions:
    - What types of **VR interventions** (CAVE, desktop VR, HMD) have been used for social skills training in ASD?
    - What **social skills domains** (e.g., emotion recognition, nonverbal communication) are targeted?
    - What **methodologies** (experimental, quasi-experimental, single-subject, mixed methods) are applied?
    - What are the **advantages and limitations** of VR-based ASD interventions?

### Scope of the Review

- Covers **VR interventions** for **social skills training** in ASD.
- **Systematic review** approach, analyzing studies published between **2014‚Äì2024**.
- Includes different **VR technologies** (HMD, desktop, CAVE) and various **social skill domains** (emotion recognition, reciprocity, etc.).

### Key Inclusion Criteria

- **Empirical studies** published in peer-reviewed journals (2014‚Äì2024).
- Studies involving **children with ASD** as the primary intervention group.
- Studies targeting **social skills development** using **VR**.

| Empirical studies (RCTs, mixed methods) | Non-English papers |
| Focus on ASD interventions | Studies before 2014 |
| VR-based social skills training | No primary ASD focus |

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Selection & Data Sources

- **Databases searched:** Google Scholar, EBSCOhost, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, PubMed.
- **Search strategy:** Boolean operators **AND/OR** for combinations like:
    - `Autism AND Virtual Reality AND Social Skills`
    - `ASD OR Virtual Experience OR Social Communication`
- **Screening process:** Three reviewers used **Covidence** software for systematic selection.
- **Number of studies included:** **31 studies** after screening **634 records**.

| Search Strategy   | Keywords Used |
|------------------|--------------|
| Population      | Autism, ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder |
| Intervention   | Virtual Reality, VR, Virtual Experience |
| Outcome       | Social Skills, Interpersonal Interaction |


### Data Extraction & Quality Assessment

- **Data extraction:** Conducted by three reviewers.
- **Risk of Bias Assessment:** Considered study **methodology, sample sizes, and control groups**.
- **Meta-Analysis Methods:** Not performed (qualitative synthesis instead).
- **Heterogeneity assessment:** Variation in **sample sizes, VR types, intervention designs**.

| Quality Assessment | Method |
|------------------|--------------|
| Data Extraction | Conducted by three reviewers |
| Bias Assessment | Considered study design, sample size |
| Meta-Analysis | Not performed (qualitative synthesis) |
| Heterogeneity | Analyzed across methodologies |


## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Overview of Included Studies

| Parameter               | Value |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Number of Studies      | 31 |
| Sample Size Range     | 3 ‚Äì 52 participants per study |
| Study Designs         | RCTs, Quasi-experimental, Mixed Methods |
| Geographical Scope    | International (Europe, USA, Asia) |


### Main Findings

- **VR can improve social interaction and emotional recognition** in children with ASD.
- **Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) and CAVE systems** were more immersive but **desktop VR was more accessible**.
- **Collaborative VR settings (multi-user interactions) were effective**.
- **Mixed results** on **long-term retention** of skills.

### Primary Outcomes & Effect Sizes

- **Significant improvements** in **social communication** and **emotion recognition**.
- **Effectiveness varied** depending on **intervention length, sample size, and VR type**.

### Heterogeneity & Publication Bias

- Studies **highly heterogeneous** in:
    - **Sample sizes** (3‚Äì52 participants).
    - **VR systems** (CAVE, HMD, desktop).
    - **Outcome measures**.
- **Limited evidence** of publication bias due to **lack of meta-analysis**.

| Findings  | Observations |
|----------|--------------|
| VR improved social interaction | Positive in 80% of studies |
| Mixed results in emotion recognition | Some studies found no significant impact |
| Long-term skill retention unclear | Limited follow-up assessments |
