> ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to implement a validated, university-based early detection program, the Get SET Early model, in a community-based setting. Get SET was developed to improve Screening, Evaluation, and Treatment referral practices. Specifically, its purpose was to lower the age of diagnosis and enable toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to begin treatment by 36 months.MethodsOne hundred nine pediatric health care providers were recruited to administer the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile Infant-Toddler Checklist at 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month well-baby visits and referred toddlers whose scores indicated the need for a developmental evaluation. Licensed psychologists were trained to provide diagnostic evaluations to toddlers as young as 12 months. Mean age of diagnosis was compared with current population rates.ResultsIn 4 years, 45,504 screens were administered at well-baby visits, and 648 children were evaluated at least 1 time. The overall median age for ASD diagnosis was 22 months, which is significantly lower than the median age reported by the CDC (57 months). For children screened at 12 months, the age of first diagnosis was significantly lower at 15 months. Of the 350 children who completed at least 1 follow-up evaluation, 323 were diagnosed with ASD or another delay, and 239 (74%) were enrolled in a treatment program.ConclusionToddlers with ASD were diagnosed nearly 3 years earlier than the most recent CDC report, which allowed children to start a treatment program by 36 months. Overall, Get SET Early was an effective strategy for improving the current approach to screening, evaluation, and treatment. Efforts to demonstrate sustainability are underway.
