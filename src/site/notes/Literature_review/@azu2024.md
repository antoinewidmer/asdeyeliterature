> Clinician and caregiver reports of autism features are both integral to receiving an autism diagnosis and appropriate intervention, yet informant discrepancies are present in clinical practice and may differ by demographic characteristics of the child and family. The present study examined how clinician–caregiver discrepancies in ratings of a child’s autism-related behaviors relate to a child’s sex at birth, age at first diagnosis, and amount of intervention received. Participants were 280 children (76.8% male, 67.9% White), 6–11 years old (M = 8.5 ± 1.6), with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Variable-centered and person-centered approaches were used to examine relationships between standardized clinician–caregiver discrepancy and participant characteristics. Both analytic approaches indicated that clinicians rated autism-related behaviors lower than caregivers for females and higher than caregivers for males. In addition, lower clinician ratings of autism features, relative to caregiver ratings, were associated with older age at diagnosis and fewer hours of intervention. Findings underscore the importance of incorporating multiple informants, especially caregivers, in the diagnostic process and developing diagnostic procedures sensitive to the female autism phenotype to facilitate diagnosis, intervention, and subsequent development.
Lay abstract
In some cases, a clinician’s perceptions of a child’s autism-related behaviors are not the same as the child’s caregiver’s perceptions. Identifying how these discrepancies relate to the characteristics of the child is critical for ensuring that diagnosis procedures are unbiased and suitable for all children. This study examined whether discrepancies between clinician and caregiver reports of autism features related to the child’s sex at birth. We also explored how the discrepancies related to the age at which the child received their autism diagnosis and how much intervention they received. We found that clinicians rated autism features higher than caregivers for boys and rated autism features lower than caregivers for girls. In addition, lower clinician relative to parent ratings was related to being diagnosed at an older age and receiving less intervention. These findings suggest that there is more to learn about the presentation of autism-related behaviors in girls. When caregiver and clinician ratings of autism features do not align, it may be important to consider caregivers’ ratings to obtain a more accurate picture of the child’s autism features and the support they may need.

### 📌 Summary

- The study examines **clinician–caregiver informant discrepancies** in autism diagnosis and how they relate to **sex, age at diagnosis, and intervention use**.
- **280 autistic children (6–11 years old)** were analyzed using **ADOS-2 (clinician assessment)** and **SRS-2 (caregiver report)**.
- **Clinicians rated autism features higher than caregivers for boys** and **lower than caregivers for girls**, highlighting potential biases in diagnostic assessments.
- **Greater discrepancies** (clinicians rating lower than caregivers) were associated with **later autism diagnosis and reduced intervention hours**.
- The study underscores the need for **improving diagnostic procedures** to **better capture the female autism phenotype** and ensure **timely interventions**.

---

### 🔬 Methods

#### Study Design

- **Cross-sectional study** using **variable-centered and person-centered approaches** to analyze informant discrepancies.
- **Autism features were assessed using two measures**:
    - **ADOS-2 (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd edition)** – clinician report.
    - **SRS-2 (Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd edition)** – caregiver report.
- **Statistical analyses** included **latent profile analysis (LPA)** to identify subgroups based on clinician–caregiver rating differences.

#### Participants

| Characteristic       | Value |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Total Sample**    | 280 autistic children (6–11 years old) |
| **Sex Distribution** | 215 males (76.8%), 65 females (23.2%) |
| **Race/Ethnicity**  | 67.9% White, 7.9% Black, 5.4% Asian, 16.1% Multiracial |
| **Average Full-Scale IQ** | 96.6 (SD = 18.1) |
| **ADOS-2 Calibrated Severity Score** | Mean = 7.65 (SD = 1.77) |
| **Age at Diagnosis** | Mean = 47.93 months (~4 years) |
| **Hours of Intervention** | Mean = 38.46 hours in past 6 weeks |

**Criticism**:

- **Predominantly male sample** limits **generalizability to autistic females**.
- **Lack of racial/ethnic diversity analysis**—differences in **diagnosis rates across racial groups** were not explored.
- **Participants were required to have an IQ above 60**, excluding **lower-functioning autistic individuals**.

#### Tasks for Participants

| Task Name                | Purpose                                    | Format                        | Data Collected |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **ADOS-2 Assessment** | Standardized autism diagnosis | Structured clinician-led assessment | Social affect, repetitive behaviors |
| **SRS-2 Questionnaire** | Parent-reported autism traits | 65-item caregiver questionnaire | Social communication, restricted interests |
| **Developmental History Survey** | Collect age of diagnosis data | Parent report | Age at first ASD diagnosis |
| **Intervention Use Survey** | Measure intervention exposure | Parent report | Number of therapy hours received |


**Criticism**:

- **ADOS-2 may not fully capture the female autism phenotype**, leading to **underdiagnosis in girls**.
- **SRS-2 relies on parental perception**, which may introduce **subjective biases**.

### 📊 Results & Key Findings

#### Key Findings:

- **Clinicians rated autism traits higher than caregivers for males** but **lower than caregivers for females**.
- **Larger discrepancies (clinicians rating lower) were associated with later autism diagnosis**.
- **Children with higher clinician ratings relative to caregivers received more intervention hours**.
- **Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) identified two groups**:
    1. **Clinician-Higher than Caregiver Group** (more boys, earlier diagnosis, more intervention).
    2. **Caregiver-Higher than Clinician Group** (more girls, later diagnosis, fewer interventions).

---

### Implications:

- **Reveals gender biases in ASD diagnosis**—female autism traits may be **under-recognized by clinicians**.
- **Supports need for multi-informant diagnostic frameworks** to **reduce gender and age biases**.
- **Suggests that late-diagnosed children may require additional screening for missed early interventions**.

### 📝 Observations

#### Strengths of the Study

✅ **Largest study to date examining clinician–caregiver discrepancies in autism ratings**.  
✅ **Uses both variable-centered and person-centered analyses** to validate findings.  
✅ **Provides empirical evidence for sex differences in informant discrepancies**.  
✅ **Reinforces the need for tailored diagnostic tools for females**.

---

#### Major Concerns and Challenges

⚠ **Assumes Clinician Ratings as the “Gold Standard”**

- **ADOS-2 may underdiagnose autistic girls**, yet **this discrepancy is framed as an error in caregiver reporting**.
- **Future research should examine if clinicians themselves are systematically misidentifying ASD in girls**.

⚠ **Lack of Longitudinal Follow-Up**

- Study **does not track whether later-diagnosed children eventually receive the same level of intervention**.
- **Would be useful to see if intervention intensity later equalizes outcomes**.

⚠ **Potential Rater Bias in Caregiver Reports**

- Caregivers **may underreport or overreport symptoms** depending on **prior knowledge and expectations**.
- **Cross-validation with real-time behavioral data (e.g., home video analysis, AI-driven assessments) would strengthen conclusions**.

⚠ **Limited Socioeconomic and Racial Analysis**

- **Most participants were White and high-income**, limiting **generalizability to marginalized groups**.
- **Differences in access to diagnosis and intervention across racial/ethnic groups remain unexplored**.

---

### Final Verdict: Important but Needs More Behavioral Data

✅ **Confirms gender biases in ASD diagnosis and intervention access**.  
⚠ **Relies too heavily on subjective reports, requiring behavioral and AI-based verification**.  
🚀 **Future studies should integrate machine learning and real-world behavior tracking to minimize rating biases**.
