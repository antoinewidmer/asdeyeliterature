> One of the biggest difficulties faced by children with Autism Spectrum Disorder during their learning process and general life, is communication and social interaction. In recent years, researchers and practitioners have invested in different approaches to improving aspects of their communication and learning. However, there is still no consolidated approach and the community is still looking for new approaches that can meet this need. Addressing this challenge, in this article we propose a novelty approach (i.e., an Adaptive Immersive Virtual Reality Training System), aiming to enrich social interaction and communication skills for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. In this adaptive system (called My Lovely Granny’s Farm), the behavior of the virtual trainer changes depending on the mood and actions of the users (i.e., patients/learners). Additionally, we conducted an initial observational study by monitoring the behavior of children with autism in a virtual environment. In the initial study, the system was offered to users with a high degree of interactivity so that they might practice various social situations in a safe and controlled environment. The results demonstrate that the use of the system can allow patients who needed treatment to receive therapy without leaving home. Our approach is the first experience of treating children with autism in Kazakhstan and can contribute to improving the communication and social interaction of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. We contribute to the community of educational technologies and mental health by providing a system that can improve communication among children with autism and providing insights on how to design this kind of system.
