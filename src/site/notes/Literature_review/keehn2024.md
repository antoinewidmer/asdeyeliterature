> Finding effective and scalable solutions to address diagnostic delays and disparities in autism is a public health imperative. Approaches that integrate eye-tracking biomarkers into tiered community-based models of autism evaluation hold promise for addressing this problem.To determine whether a battery of eye-tracking biomarkers can reliably differentiate young children with and without autism in a community-referred sample collected during clinical evaluation in the primary care setting and to evaluate whether combining eye-tracking biomarkers with primary care practitioner (PCP) diagnosis and diagnostic certainty is associated with diagnostic outcome.Early Autism Evaluation (EAE) Hub system PCPs referred a consecutive sample of children to this prospective diagnostic study for blinded eye-tracking index test and follow-up expert evaluation from June 7, 2019, to September 23, 2022. Participants included 146 children (aged 14-48 months) consecutively referred by 7 EAE Hubs. Of 154 children enrolled, 146 provided usable data for at least 1 eye-tracking measure.The primary outcomes were sensitivity and specificity of a composite eye-tracking (ie, index) test, which was a consolidated measure based on significant eye-tracking indices, compared with reference standard expert clinical autism diagnosis. Secondary outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of an integrated approach using an index test and PCP diagnosis and certainty.Among 146 children (mean [SD] age, 2.6 [0.6] years; 104 [71%] male; 21 [14%] Hispanic or Latine and 96 [66%] non-Latine White; 102 [70%] with a reference standard autism diagnosis), 113 (77%) had concordant autism outcomes between the index (composite biomarker) and reference outcomes, with 77.5% sensitivity (95% CI, 68.4%-84.5%) and 77.3% specificity (95% CI, 63.0%-87.2%). When index diagnosis was based on the combination of a composite biomarker, PCP diagnosis, and diagnostic certainty, outcomes were concordant with reference standard for 114 of 127 cases (90%) with a sensitivity of 90.7% (95% CI, 83.3%-95.0%) and a specificity of 86.7% (95% CI, 70.3%-94.7%).In this prospective diagnostic study, a composite eye-tracking biomarker was associated with a best-estimate clinical diagnosis of autism, and an integrated diagnostic model including PCP diagnosis and diagnostic certainty demonstrated improved sensitivity and specificity. These findings suggest that equipping PCPs with a multimethod diagnostic approach has the potential to substantially improve access to timely, accurate diagnosis in local communities.

- **Findings**:
    - A **composite eye-tracking biomarker** had **77.5% sensitivity** and **77.3% specificity** for ASD.
    - **When combined with PCP diagnosis and certainty**, accuracy improved to **90.7% sensitivity** and **86.7% specificity**.
    - **Gaze-based markers provide additional value beyond PCP diagnosis alone**, suggesting **a role for AI-driven ASD screening tools**.


## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- **Prospective diagnostic study** conducted from **June 2019 to September 2022**.
- **Participants referred by PCPs** at EAE hubs for autism evaluation.
- **Blinded eye-tracking assessments** were performed within **16 weeks** of referral.
- **Reference standard diagnosis** determined by a **licensed psychologist using ADOS-2, VABS-3, and MSEL**.

**Criticism**:

- **No detailed breakdown of ASD severity levels** (e.g., mild vs. severe ASD).
- **Ethnic diversity is low**, limiting generalizability.

## üìä **Results & Key Findings**

### Key Findings:

- **Eye-tracking biomarkers had 77.5% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity** in differentiating ASD from non-ASD.
- **PCP diagnosis alone had lower accuracy than eye-tracking biomarkers**.
- **Combining PCP diagnosis, diagnostic certainty, and biomarkers improved accuracy to 90.7% sensitivity and 86.7% specificity**.
- **Children with lower social gaze and increased nonsocial preference had lower adaptive functioning scores**.
- **Higher fixation duration was associated with ASD, while shorter pupillary light reflex latency predicted ASD**.

### Implications for the Project

- **Supports the feasibility of using eye-tracking for scalable ASD screening in primary care**.
- **Suggests that eye-tracking can enhance clinician judgment, reducing diagnostic uncertainty**.
- **Findings could inform AI-driven gaze analysis tools for ASD stratification**.



## üîç Related Work

- **Builds on previous work (Pierce et al., 2016) on social vs. nonsocial gaze differences in ASD**.
- **Aligns with studies (Jones & Klin, 2013) that show gaze patterns are predictive of ASD risk**.
- **Expands prior research (Nystr√∂m et al., 2018) on pupillary light reflex differences in ASD**.



## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

‚úÖ **Large community-referred sample (146 children) improves real-world relevance**.  
‚úÖ **Integration of eye-tracking biomarkers with clinical diagnosis enhances accuracy**.  
‚úÖ **First study to test eye-tracking ASD biomarkers in a primary care setting**.  
‚úÖ **Use of a multimodal approach (gaze, pupillary response, oculomotor behavior)**.


### Major Concerns and Challenges

‚ö† **Limited Generalizability**

- **Sample is predominantly male (71%) and non-Hispanic White (66%)**.
- **Lack of diversity raises concerns about applicability to broader populations**.

‚ö† **Lack of Longitudinal Validation**

- **No follow-up data on whether eye-tracking biomarkers predict long-term ASD outcomes**.

‚ö† **Potential Overfitting in Classification Models**

- **Reported AUC values are high (0.90+), but generalization to unseen data is unclear**.

‚ö† **Reliance on Static Lab-Based Stimuli**

- **No real-world social interactions tested**‚Äîcould the biomarkers work in a natural setting?



### Final Verdict: Strong but Needs Further Validation

‚úÖ **Promising approach for integrating AI-driven biomarkers into primary care ASD screening**.  
‚ö† **Requires external validation, increased demographic diversity, and real-world deployment studies**.
