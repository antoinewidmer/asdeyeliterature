>
> Nowadays there is an increase in number of autisms, a neuro-developmental disorder across the world. The level of autism varies with the symptoms such as inattention, interaction, social communication, repetitive behaviors, irritability and the like. Early recovery of a child from autism is necessary to live in a normal socio-communicable life. To measure the inattention of the autism child by enhancing the visual perception through virtual environment. The proposed Virtual Reality Intervention (VRI) enhances visual perception, learning, and social interaction. The proposed method observes the attention level of the autism child through eye tracking or eye movements who interacts with virtual world using eye tracking methodology. As eye tracking is the major component to measure the reduced looking time of objects and subjects which considered being the earliest signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). For observing the attention of kids during testing, Eye movements and gestures plays a major role. Using head position and eye pupil direction, attention has been analyzed. Quantitative and Qualitative findings conclude that the inattention of autism child can gradually be reduced by iterating the virtual therapy through eye ball tracking technique. Qualitative finding is done using Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and quantitative using eye-pupil and head position. Autism affected children can easily recovered from this inattention symptom by continuous iterations on virtual therapy. Similar virtual therapies can also be provided to address other symptoms of autism.
