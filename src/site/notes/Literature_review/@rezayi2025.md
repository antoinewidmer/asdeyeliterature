> Compared to typically developing people, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have distinct cognitive and intelligence profiles. Some of these children require cognitive rehabilitation. Through the use of cutting-edge therapy and cognitive empowerment methods, some cognitive skills in children with ASD can be strengthened by digital game-based tools. This studyâ€™s main purpose is to provide a systematic review and qualitative study about designing digital games for cognitive enhancement in autistic children and to determine the main design components of such digital games. The primary focus of this study is to explore the citations in which the technical and functional elements are provided thoroughly. Furthermore, a conceptual framework is elaborated for designing a digital game for autism. A thorough review of the literature was conducted in the databases of Medline (via PubMed), Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, and IEEE Xplore for English publications published before January 23, 2023. Of 976 papers, 34 studies were found to be eligible in this systematic review. The bulk of the studies were carried out in Asia and Europe. Three (8.8%) studies used games that were built to be multilingual, while 22 (64.7%) studies used games that were only created in English. Creating motivation through narratives, providing incentive systems, raising the complexity level, targeting main skills, and adjusting the choices are the principal components of digital game design. (1) Main cognitive rehabilitation domains in ASD; (2) game designing details: platforms and game genres, motivations, evaluations, game graphics designs, aesthetic mechanisms, incentive systems, and famous game development engines; and (3) mutual interaction between child, therapist, and parents are the crucial categories that are described to devise a conceptual framework in this qualitative study. Of the total number of included studies, 25 studies reported positive effects on autism cases, and in nine, there has not been any evaluation of real cases; however, only usability tests have been conducted. Children with autism may benefit from using appropriate digital game-based interventions to improve mental indices. According to a review, it can be stated that the suitable computerized and digital game-based solutions could enhance cognitive outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorder. However, more research is required to ascertain the true efficacy of these new technologies.
