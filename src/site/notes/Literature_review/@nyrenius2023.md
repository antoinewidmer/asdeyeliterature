> Background
Patients with ‚Äòunderlying‚Äô autism spectrum disorder (ASD) constitute a significant minority in adult out-patient psychiatry. Diagnoses of previously unrecognised ASD are increasing in adults. Characteristics of patients with autism within adult out-patient psychiatry have not been sufficiently explored, and there have not been any systematic comparisons of characteristics between patients with and those without autism within adult out-patient psychiatric populations.

Aims
To examine psychiatrically relevant characteristics in autistic adult psychiatric out-patients, and to compare the characteristics with non-autistic adult psychiatric out-patients.

Method
We assessed 90 patients who were referred to a Swedish psychiatric out-patient clinic and screened for ASD during 2019‚Äì2020. Sixty-three patients met the DSM-5 criteria for ASD or ‚Äòsubthreshold‚Äô ASD. The 27 who did not meet the criteria for ASD were used as a comparison group. Assessments were made with structured and well-validated instruments, including parent ratings of developmental history.

Results
No differences were found between the groups regarding self-reported sociodemographic variables. The ASD group showed a higher number of co-occurring psychiatric disorders than the non-ASD group (t(88) = 5.17, 95% CI 1.29‚Äì2.91, d = 1.19). Functional level was lower in the ASD group (t(88) = ‚àí2.66, 95% CI ‚àí9.46 to ‚àí1.27, d = ‚àí0.73), and was predicted by the number of co-occurring psychiatric disorders.

Conclusions
The results underscore the need for thorough assessment of psychiatric disorders in autistic patients in adult psychiatric services. ASD should be considered as a possible ‚Äòunderlying‚Äô condition in adult psychiatry, and there is no easy way of ruling out ASD in this population.

## üìå Summary

- The study examines psychiatrically relevant characteristics in adult psychiatric out-patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and compares these characteristics to those of non-autistic adult psychiatric out-patients.
- It addresses the increasing diagnoses of previously unrecognised ASD in adults and the need for more exploration of characteristics in adult psychiatric patients with autism.
- The study underscores the need for thorough assessment of psychiatric disorders in autistic patients within adult psychiatric services.
- The study suggests ASD should be considered as a possible ‚Äòunderlying‚Äô condition in adult psychiatry, as there is no easy way of ruling it out in this population.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

The study assessed 90 patients referred to a Swedish psychiatric out-patient clinic and screened for ASD during 2019‚Äì2020. 63 patients met the DSM-5 criteria for ASD or ‚Äòsubthreshold‚Äô ASD, while the remaining 27 did not meet the criteria and were used as a comparison group. Assessments were made using structured and well-validated instruments, including parent ratings of developmental history.

### Participants

|Characteristic|ASD Group (n = 52)|Subthreshold ASD Group (n = 11)|Non-ASD Group (n = 27)|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Gender (Male/Female)|20/32|7/4|9/18|
|Age (Mean, s.d.)|30.6, 9.8|38.6, 11.7|29.0, 10.4|
|IQ Estimate (Mean, s.d.)|99.9, 11.7|N/A|N/A|
|DSM-5 Criteria Met (Mean, s.d.)|5.40, 0.69|4.27, 0.47|1.85, 1.13|
|Asperger Syndrome (Gillberg & Gillberg's criteria)|22|0|0|

- The total sample included 90 participants (36 males, 54 females) with an age range of 18‚Äì65 years. The age mean was 31.0 years (s.d. = 10.5), and the IQ estimate mean was 99.9 (s.d. = 11.7).
- **The ASD group (n = 52) met the full DSM-5 criteria for ASD**.
- **The subthreshold ASD group (n = 11) met two rather than all three of the A-criteria and at least two of the B-criteria**.
- The non-ASD group (n = 27) did not meet the criteria for ASD or subthreshold ASD.

### Tasks for participants

|Task|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|RAADS-R/RAADS-14 Screen|Initial screening for ASD in adults|Self-rating scale (80 items/14 items)|Total score indicating likelihood of ASD|
|MINI|Assessment of psychiatric conditions|Short, structured diagnostic interview|Occurrence of common psychiatric disorders according to DSM-5|
|AUDIT/DUDIT|Assessments of alcohol and narcotics consumption|Short self-rating scales|Scores indicating hazardous alcohol use or drug-related problems|
|WAIS-IV Subtests (Matrix, Coding, Symbol Search)|Assessment of cognitive functioning|Cognitive tests|Estimate of IQ level and processing speed index (PSI) score|
|FTF|Parent questionnaire to measure difficulties in childhood and youth|Questionnaire completed by parents, based on participant's presentation at 17 years of age|Difficulties in various domains, useful for retrospective assessment of childhood symptoms|
|ASDI|Gathering information about symptoms of ASD|Semi-structured interview consisting of 20 questions|Scores ranging from 0 to 40, used as an aid in preliminary diagnostic decisions|
|Self-rating questionnaire|Covering living conditions, relationships, educational background, vocational status, economy, contacts with social services, healthcare contacts including psychiatry, prior assessments and medicine use|Questionnaire with multiple questions|Information about sociodemographic/socioeconomic characteristics|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings:

- **No differences** were found in sociodemographic characteristics between the merged ASD group and the non-ASD group.
- The merged ASD group had **more** neurodevelopmental disorders and anxiety disorders compared to the non-ASD group.
- The merged ASD group had **significantly more** co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses compared with the non-ASD group.
- **GAF scores were lower** in the merged ASD group compared with the non-ASD group.
- **Number of co-occurring psychiatric non-mood diagnoses and current/ongoing mood disorder explained 26.7% of the variability in GAF scores** in the merged ASD group.

### Implications:

- ASD should be ruled out as an ‚Äòunderlying‚Äô disorder in adult psychiatric patients.
- There is a need for careful clinical assessment of co-occurring psychiatric disorders in autistic adults within adult psychiatric care services.
- Treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders is possibly the most important way of increasing the functional level in autistic adult psychiatric out-patients.
- The similarities between autistic and non-autistic adult psychiatric out-patients seem to outweigh the differences, although clear differences exist in clinically assessed symptoms of ASD.

## üîç Related Work

The paper references several studies related to ASD prevalence in adult psychiatric settings, factors contributing to delayed ASD diagnosis, and co-occurring conditions.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- In-depth clinical assessments using validated instruments.
- Assessments performed by experienced clinicians.
- Comparison of patients with and without ASD within an adult psychiatric out-patient population.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Small sample size in the comparison group (the non-ASD group).
- Low participation rate, which has implications for the representativity of the sample and limits generalisability of the findings.
- Lack of parent-reported developmental history in a significant proportion of the study group, which could have led to an over- or underassessment of ASD in the sample.
- The instruments available for diagnosing ASD show inferior psychometric properties when applied to adult psychiatric patients.
