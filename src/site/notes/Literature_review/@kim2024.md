> Background: Individuals with autism often experience heightened anxiety in workplace environments because of challenges in communication and sensory overload. As these experiences can result in negative self-image, promoting their self-efficacy in the workplace is crucial. Virtual reality (VR) systems have emerged as promising tools for enhancing the self-efficacy of individuals with autism in navigating social scenarios, aiding in the identification of anxiety-inducing situations, and preparing for real-world interactions. However, there is limited research exploring the potential of VR to enhance self-efficacy by facilitating an understanding of emotional and physiological states during social skills practice. Objective: This study aims to develop and evaluate a VR system that enabled users to experience simulated work-related social scenarios and reflect on their behavioral and physiological data through data visualizations. We intended to investigate how these data, combined with the simulations, can support individuals with autism in building their self-efficacy in social skills. Methods: We developed WorkplaceVR, a comprehensive VR system designed for engagement in simulated work-related social scenarios, supplemented with data-driven reflections of users’ behavioral and physiological responses. A within-subject deployment study was subsequently conducted with 14 young adults with autism to examine WorkplaceVR’s feasibility. A mixed methods approach was used, compassing pre- and postsystem use assessments of participants’ self-efficacy perceptions. Results: The study results revealed WorkplaceVR’s effectiveness in enhancing social skills and self-efficacy among individuals with autism. First, participants exhibited a statistically significant increase in perceived self-efficacy following their engagement with the VR system (P=.02). Second, thematic analysis of the interview data confirmed that the VR system and reflections on the data fostered increased self-awareness among participants about social situations that trigger their anxiety, as well as the behaviors they exhibit during anxious moments. This increased self-awareness prompted the participants to recollect their related experiences in the real world and articulate anxiety management strategies. Furthermore, the insights uncovered motivated participants to engage in self-advocacy, as they wanted to share the insights with others. Conclusions: This study highlights the potential of VR simulations enriched with physiological and behavioral sensing as a valuable tool for augmenting self-efficacy in workplace social interactions for individuals with autism. Data reflection facilitated by physiological sensors helped participants with autism become more self-aware of their emotions and behaviors, advocate for their characteristics, and develop positive self-beliefs.

## 📝 Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- **Comprehensive VR system:** WorkplaceVR integrates realistic work scenarios, evidence-based social skills interventions, and multiple levels of difficulty.
- **Data-driven reflection:** The system provides users with visualizations of their behavioral and physiological data, promoting self-awareness and self-understanding.
- **Mixed-methods approach:** The study combines quantitative data (self-efficacy scores, presence questionnaires, sensor data) with qualitative data (interviews) to provide a comprehensive understanding of the VR system's impact.
- **User-centered design:** The VR program was developed using an inclusive and iterative design process, incorporating feedback from individuals with autism, managers, psychiatrists, and professional counselors.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- **Limited generalizability:** The study only included participants with autism who are able to communicate and interact with others, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
- **Algorithm for anxiety detection**: The algorithm used to estimate anxiety moments may not be entirely accurate.
- **Lack of validated measures:** The PSES-VR and IPQ measures had not been previously validated in the Korean population.
- **Translation to real-life situations:** The study could not confirm whether participants’ experiences in the study would translate to their real-life situations through post-study observations.
- **Need for diverse data:** Participants suggested that having more diverse data (e.g., facial expressions, body movements, and gestures) could help them better reflect on and understand their behaviors.
- **Data Accuracy**: Participants were informed that the data may not be accurate because of technical issues, so there can be errors or missing data in the interface.
