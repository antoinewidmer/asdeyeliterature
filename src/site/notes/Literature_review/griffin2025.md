> Background
Reduced social attention‚Äîlooking at faces‚Äîis one of the most common manifestations of social difficulty in autism that is central to social development. Although reduced social attention is well characterized in autism, qualitative differences in how social attention unfolds across time remains unknown.
Methods
We used a computational modeling (i.e., hidden Markov modeling) approach to assess and compare the spatiotemporal dynamics of social attention in a large, well-characterized sample of children with autism (n¬†= 280) and neurotypical children (n¬†= 119) (ages 6‚Äì11) who completed 3 social eye-tracking assays at 3 longitudinal time points (baseline, 6 weeks, 24 weeks).
Results
Our analysis supported the existence of 2 common eye movement patterns that emerged across 3 eye-tracking assays. A focused pattern was characterized by small face regions of interest, which had high a probability of capturing fixations early in visual processing. In contrast, an exploratory pattern was characterized by larger face regions of interest, with a lower initial probability of fixation and more nonsocial regions of interest. In the context of social perception, children with autism showed significantly more exploratory eye movement patterns than neurotypical children across all social perception assays and all 3 longitudinal time points. Eye movement patterns were associated with clinical features of autism, including adaptive function, face recognition, and autism symptom severity.
Conclusions
Decreased likelihood of precisely looking at faces early in social visual processing may be an important feature of autism that is associated with autism-related symptomology and may reflect less visual sensitivity to face information.

## üìå Summary

- The study investigates the **spatiotemporal eye movement dynamics** in autistic children to understand face prioritization in early visual processing.
- A **computational hidden Markov model (HMM) approach** was used to analyze gaze patterns in a **large, well-characterized sample**.
- Autistic children exhibited **more exploratory eye movement patterns**, characterized by **reduced fixations on faces** early in visual processing.
- Eye movement patterns were **associated with clinical ASD characteristics**, including **adaptive function, face recognition ability, and autism symptom severity**.
- The study provides **biomarker insights** that could inform **future diagnostic and intervention strategies** for autism.


## üî¨ Methods

### **Study Design**

- **Longitudinal eye-tracking study** conducted at **three time points** (baseline, 6 weeks, 24 weeks).
- Computational **hidden Markov modeling (HMM)** was used to analyze gaze transitions between **regions of interest (ROIs)** in face images.
- Participants viewed **three different social eye-tracking assays** using static and dynamic stimuli.

### **Participants**

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age (Mean ¬± SD)|Diagnosis|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Autistic|280|215/65|8.55 ¬± 1.64|ASD (ADOS-2, DSM-5 confirmed)|
|Neurotypical|119|83/36|8.51 ¬± 1.61|No psychiatric conditions|



### **Tasks for Participants**

|Task|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### **Key Findings**

- **Autistic children showed more exploratory eye movements**, with a lower probability of fixating on faces early in viewing.
- **Neurotypical children prioritized face ROIs more rapidly**, demonstrating a **focused viewing strategy**.
- Exploratory eye movement patterns were **significantly correlated** with higher **ADOS-2 autism severity scores**.
- Autistic children had **lower face recognition memory scores (NEPSY-II)**, suggesting a relationship between **eye movement patterns and social cognition**.
- Eye movement patterns remained **stable over the 24-week period**, indicating that these gaze behaviors are **trait-like markers** of autism rather than momentary variability.

### **Implications**

- The study provides **strong evidence** that **early visual processing strategies** in autism differ fundamentally from neurotypical individuals.
- These **gaze dynamics may serve as biomarkers** for ASD, aiding in **early diagnosis and individualized intervention**.
- The findings support **theory-driven models of autism**, such as **reduced social orienting and atypical neural specialization for faces**.
