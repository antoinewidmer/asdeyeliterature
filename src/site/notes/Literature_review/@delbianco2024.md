> Face-processing timing differences may underlie visual social attention differences between autistic and non-autistic people, and males and females. This study investigates the timing of the effects of neurotype and sex on face-processing, and their dependence on age. We analysed EEG data during upright and inverted photographs of faces from 492 participants from the Longitudinal European Autism Project (141 neurotypical males, 76 neurotypical females, 202 autistic males, 73 autistic females; age 6‚Äì30¬†years). We detected timings of sex/diagnosis effects on event-related potential amplitudes at the posterior‚Äìtemporal channel P8 with Bootstrapped Cluster-based Permutation Analysis and conducted Growth Curve Analysis (GCA) to investigate the timecourse and dependence on age of neural signals. The periods of influence of neurotype and sex overlapped but differed in onset (respectively, 260 and 310¬†ms post-stimulus), with sex effects lasting longer. GCA revealed a smaller and later amplitude peak in autistic female children compared to non-autistic female children; this difference decreased in adolescence and was not significant in adulthood. No age-dependent neurotype difference was significant in males. These findings indicate that sex and neurotype influence longer latency face processing and implicates cognitive rather than perceptual processing. Sex may have more overarching effects than neurotype on configural face processing.

## üìå Summary

- The study investigates sex differences in social brain neural responses during configural face processing in autistic and non-autistic individuals.
- Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured with EEG to analyze timing differences in response to upright and inverted faces.
- Results suggest that sex and neurotype affect face processing at different time points, with sex differences appearing earlier and lasting longer.
- Autistic females showed distinct processing patterns compared to non-autistic females during childhood, but these differences reduced in adolescence and disappeared in adulthood.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- Cross-sectional study analyzing EEG responses to face stimuli.
- Utilized Bootstrapped Cluster-based Permutation Analysis (BCPA) and Growth Curve Analysis (GCA).

### Participants

|Group|N|Gender (M/F)|Age Range|Mean Age (SD)|Diagnosis|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Neurotypical|217|141/76|6.89-30.78|17.16 (5.70)|No developmental conditions|
|Autistic|275|202/73|6.08-30.28|16.98 (5.48)|DSM-5 ASD diagnosis|

### Tasks for Participants

Participants viewed upright and inverted face images while neural responses were recorded.

|Task|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|
|Face Viewing|Analyze configural face processing|Presentation of faces|EEG responses, eye tracking|
|Face Inversion|Examine inversion effects on processing|Upright/inverted faces|ERP components (N170, P300)|

### System Setup and Hardware

|Device|Purpose|Specifications|
|---|---|---|
|EEG System (64-ch)|Record neural activity|500 Hz sampling, 10-20 layout|
|MATLAB TaskEngine|Stimuli presentation|Real-time face presentation|
|Eye Tracker|Track gaze patterns|500 Hz sampling|

### Data Analysis

|Feature|Task|Description|
|---|---|---|
|N170 Amplitude|Face Viewing|Measures configural face processing|
|P300 Amplitude|Face Viewing|Measures novelty detection|
|Inversion Effect|Face Inversion|Difference between upright and inverted faces|
|ERP Time Clusters|All tasks|Onset and duration of sex/neurotype effects|

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings

- Neurotype differences were significant at 310 ms, whereas sex differences began at 260 ms.
- Autistic females had smaller and delayed ERP peaks compared to non-autistic females during childhood.
- Differences in ERP profiles between autistic and non-autistic females diminished with age.
- No significant age-dependent neurotype differences were found in males.

### Implications

- Face processing differences in autism may result from both perceptual and cognitive processing variations.
- Age and sex must be considered when interpreting neural responses to social stimuli.
- The observed developmental convergence between autistic and non-autistic females could influence diagnostic practices.

## üîç Related Work

- Supports prior research on atypical face processing in autism.
- Extends findings by identifying time-cluster differences based on sex and age.
- Aligns with literature on increased social attention in females compared to males.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

- Large sample size with robust statistical methods.
- Use of data-driven EEG analysis enhances temporal precision.
- Simultaneous consideration of sex, neurotype, and age.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

- Cross-sectional design limits developmental inferences.
- Unequal sex distribution, with fewer autistic females.
- EEG measures focus on one electrode (P8), potentially missing broader effects.
- Eye-tracking data quality was inconsistent across participants.
- Stimuli were static faces, which may not fully capture social attention mechanisms.

The study underscores the need for longitudinal investigations into the developmental trajectories of face processing differences in autism across sexes.
