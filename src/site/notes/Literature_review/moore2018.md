> [!Abstract]
>
> The wide range of ability and disability in ASD creates a need for tools that parse the phenotypic heterogeneity into meaningful subtypes. Using eye tracking, our past studies revealed that when presented with social and geometric images, a subset of ASD toddlers preferred viewing geometric images, and these toddlers also had greater symptom severity than ASD toddlers with greater social attention. This study tests whether this ‚ÄúGeoPref test‚Äù effect would generalize across different social stimuli.

## üìå Summary

- The study investigates a specific ASD subgroup, the **Geometric Preference (GeoPref) subtype**, which prefers viewing geometric patterns over social stimuli.
- The study tests the **Complex Social GeoPref test**, where toddlers viewed dynamic social and geometric images.
- ASD toddlers displayed a higher preference for geometric images than other diagnostic groups.
- The GeoPref subgroup had **greater symptom severity** compared to ASD toddlers with higher social attention.
- The study finds **high specificity** but moderate sensitivity for identifying ASD using eye-tracking tests.
- Results support the **potential clinical application** of the GeoPref tests in ASD screening and diagnosis.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- **Experimental eye-tracking study**
- Participants watched a **90-second video** featuring social and geometric stimuli.
- Eye movements (fixations, saccades) were analyzed for preference patterns.
- Compared results with a previous **GeoPref test**.
- Cross-validated findings with clinical measures (ADOS, MSEL, VABS).

### Participants

|Group|N|Age Range (months)|Mean Age (SD)|Male/Female|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**ASD**|76|12-48|30.0 (8.8)|70/6|
|**ASD Features**|11|15.8-40.7|31.9 (8.9)|10/1|
|**Developmental Delay (DD)**|56|12.4-46.0|26.8 (9.5)|36/20|
|**Typically Developing (TD)**|51|12.9-47.5|29.7 (9.5)|30/21|
|**Other Diagnoses**|22|13.1-47.7|33.6 (10.3)|11/11|
|**Typical Siblings (TypSib)**|11|12.2-44.6|27.8 (11.2)|4/7|

- **Recruitment:** Pediatrician referral (54%) or self-referral (46%).
- **Inclusion Criteria:** ASD diagnosed per DSM-IV or DSM-V.
- **Exclusion Criteria:** Vision abnormalities, excessive movement disrupting eye-tracking.

### Tasks for Participants

- **Task**: Watch a **90-second** video displaying **simultaneous** dynamic geometric and social stimuli.
- **Data Collected**: Fixation time per image type, saccade count, cognitive/behavioral scores.

|Task Name|Purpose|Format|Data Collected|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Complex Social GeoPref Test**|Assess preference for geometric vs. social stimuli|90-sec video|% Fixation on geometric/social images, saccades, response times|
|**Original GeoPref Test**|Cross-validate results|60-sec video|% Fixation on geometric/social images|
|**ADOS, MSEL, VABS**|Evaluate symptom severity & development|Standardized tests|Autism severity, cognitive abilities, adaptive behavior|

### System Setup and Hardware

|Device|Purpose|Specifications|
|---|---|---|
|**Tobii T-120 eye tracker**|Track gaze behavior|60 Hz sampling rate|
|**17-inch TFT monitor**|Display stimuli|60 cm viewing distance|
|**Five-point calibration system**|Ensure accuracy|Accuracy: ¬±0.5¬∞|

- Large **areas of interest (AOIs)** were used to improve tracking reliability for toddlers.

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings:

- **ASD toddlers spent significantly more time looking at geometric images** than any other group.
- Strong correlation between **fixation preference for geometric images and autism symptom severity** (ADOS scores).
- ASD children who preferred geometric images had **lower cognitive and language scores**.
- Combining both **original and Complex Social GeoPref tests improved ASD detection** (AUC = 0.75).
- **Sensitivity:** 35% (1 in 3 ASD toddlers identified).
- **Specificity:** 94% (low false positives).

---

### Implications for the Project (MOSAIC)

- **Eye-tracking as a diagnostic tool for ASD subtypes** is validated.
- **Geometric Preference is linked to increased ASD symptom severity** ‚Üí Could inform **customized intervention strategies**.
- **Potential for integrating similar paradigms** into the MOSAIC framework to **refine ASD subtyping**.
- **Cross-paradigm consistency** suggests eye-tracking could be a **reliable early-screening method**.
- **High specificity means it could be used for ASD confirmation rather than primary screening**.

---

## üîç Related Work

- Builds on previous **Pierce et al. (2011, 2016) studies** confirming geometric preference in ASD.
- Supports theories of **diminished social attention** in ASD (Jones & Klin, 2008).
- Contrasts with studies on **gaze-following in ASD**, suggesting **non-social visual preferences** could be a stronger diagnostic marker.
- Extends work on **neurodevelopmental divergence in visual processing** (Klin et al., 2009; Falck-Ytter et al., 2013).

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

‚úÖ **Large sample size (N=227)** ‚Üí Improves generalizability.  
‚úÖ **Cross-validation of results with different eye-tracking paradigms.**  
‚úÖ **Robust statistical methods** (ROC, AUC, validation statistics).  
‚úÖ **High specificity (94%)** ‚Üí Low risk of false positives.  
‚úÖ **Findings align with prior ASD literature, confirming geometric preference as a stable ASD marker.**

---

### Major Concerns and Challenges

üö® **Low sensitivity (35%)** ‚Üí Only detects 1 in 3 ASD toddlers.  
üö® **Lack of direct neural correlates** ‚Üí No brain imaging data to confirm underlying mechanisms.  
üö® **No control for stimulus complexity effects** ‚Üí Was preference due to **social avoidance** or **geometric attraction**?  
üö® **Potential attentional biases not ruled out** ‚Üí Some ASD toddlers may fixate longer due to **disengagement difficulties** rather than preference.  
üö® **Clinical utility unclear** ‚Üí Eye-tracking is **not yet a standalone diagnostic tool**; would need integration with **behavioral assessments**.  
üö® **Does not differentiate between ASD subtypes** ‚Üí More work is needed to explore whether **different cognitive profiles exist within the GeoPref subtype**.

---

## Final Thoughts

This study provides **strong evidence for an ASD subtype characterized by geometric preference** and its link to **symptom severity**. While highly specific, **the low sensitivity limits its standalone diagnostic power**. Future work should explore **neural mechanisms, attentional biases, and real-world applications** of this approach. **For MOSAIC, integrating a similar eye-tracking protocol could help refine ASD detection through multimodal assessment.**
