## **üìå Relationship Between the Three Fields**

|**Field**|**Focus**|**Common Uses in ASD Research**|
|---|---|---|
|**Eye-Tracking**|Measures **where we look**|**Reduced fixation on faces, preference for geometric stimuli**|
|**Oculometry**|Measures **how the eyes move**|**Atypical saccades, fewer gaze alternations**|
|**Pupillometry**|Measures **pupil response**|**Delayed pupillary light reflex, reduced dilation to faces**|

‚úÖ **Combining these three methods provides a more comprehensive ASD diagnostic tool.**
