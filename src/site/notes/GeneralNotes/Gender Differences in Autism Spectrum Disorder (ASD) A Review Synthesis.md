# Gender Differences in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): A Review Synthesis




## 1. Sex and Gender Differences in ASD
### 1.1 ASD Detection and Diagnosis
Several studies indicate that ASD diagnosis is more challenging in females due to differences in symptom presentation and clinical bias. [[Literature_review/bourson2024\|bourson2024]] found that autistic girls exhibited fewer restricted interests compared to boys, making screening more complex.
#### 1.1.1 Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors (RRBs)

- [[Literature_review/bourson2024\|bourson2024]] – fewer restricted interests were identified in comparison
with boys, and the autistic girls’ interests seem to be closer to those of neurotypical
girls than to those of autistic boys, which thus led to more complex screening
- [[Literature_review/young2018\|young2018]] – RRBs “concern more people than objects” in girls compared to
boys (C); “At school age and during adolescence, it appears that between girls
and boys there are more differences in repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or
activities (RRBIs) than in social communication”
- [[Literature_review/cruz2024\|cruz2024]] – The results support the importance of considering a “female autism
phenotype” potentially involving camouflaging- in the diagnostic process
- [[Literature_review/natoli2023\|natoli2023]] – meta-analysis showing fewer RRBs in females than males (p=0.07).
- [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]] number of stereotypic behaviors in boys significantly decreased over life but remained constant in girls
- [[Literature_review/edwards2024a\|edwards2024a]] significant differences in narrowly defined RRBIs in males and
females (Te and A)

#### 1.1.2 Social Interaction
- [[Literature_review/cruz2024\|cruz2024]] Autistic males exhibited more severe symptoms and social interaction
difficulties on standard clinical measures than females
- [[Literature_review/young2018\|young2018]] Boys with ASD mostly stay alone during recess, girls often have
friends of the same age to take care of them (. . . ) social deficit can be masked”
(idem Dean in Lockwood); Passivity commonly perceived as shyness (C); tendency
to mimic people (C)
- [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]] ”the use of the Faces Test to assess emotion recognition
in a clinical sample of 5- to 10-year-olds and found that girls with ASD made
significantly more mistakes than boys, indicating poorer emotion recognition skills.”
(C)
- [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]] - caregivers were more concerned about social interaction in boys than girls with ASD (Little)
- [[Literature_review/natoli2023\|natoli2023]] reported conflicting results: 12/29 studies reported sex differences
in social communication and interaction, RRBs, or social functioning with some
demonstrating females > males or females < males. 17/29 studies reported no sex
differences
- [[Literature_review/napolitano2022\|napolitano2022]] peer relationships, social attention, peer engagement behavior, difficulty engaging back and fort conversations, use of atypical gaze could be more useful to highlight specific differences 

reported that autistic males exhibit more severe social difficulties than females. [Young et al., ] found that boys with ASD often stay alone during recess, whereas girls may have peers who take care of them, potentially masking social deficits.

#### 1.1.3 Cognitive and behavioral / more difficulties in females
- [[Literature_review/cruz2024\|cruz2024]] females, (. . . ), in turn, exhibited more cognitive and behavioral difficulties
- [[Literature_review/duvekot2017\|duvekot2017]]  [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]] “in clinical-based sample, having additionalbehavioural problems increased the likelihood of obtaining an ASD diagnosis in females, whereas this effect was not present for males”
- [[Literature_review/young2018\|young2018]] Better imagination but repetitive and controlled pretense play with a lack of reciprocity

#### 1.1.4 Processing Speed and Visuospatial Abilities
- [[Literature_review/green2019\|green2019]] Some research suggests that females with ASD display better processing speed abilities and worse visuospatial abilities than males with ASD ([[Literature_review/lehnhardt2016\|lehnhardt2016]] [[Literature_review/bolte2011\|bolte2011]])

#### 1.1.5 Body & Movement
1. [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]]: ”gestures during ADOS-2 assessments were analyzed in 10 girls and 16 boys with high-functioning ASD; girls with ASD tended to use gestures more ’vividly’ (i.e. with more energy) than boys with ASD (a non-significant trend)”
2. [[Literature_review/napolitano2022\|napolitano2022]]: interpersonal motor synchrony could be more useful to highlight specific gender differences

#### 1.1.6 Camouflaging
There is a sex and gender differences in camouflaging (two types of camouflage ([Bargiela et al., ] in [[Literature_review/young2018\|young2018]]): active (use of strategies to mask their difficulties, copying peers, and overcoming social communication deficits typical of ASD to seem normal and maintain friendship) or passive (spontaneous mimicking and behavior such as accents)

1. [[Literature_review/cook2021\|cook2021]] – ”sex and gender differences exist in camouflaging”
2. [[Literature_review/cruz2024\|cruz2024]] – ”females used more compensation and masking camouflage strategies than males”.
3. [[Literature_review/young2018\|young2018]] – seems to be more specific of a female phenotype
4. [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]] – Camouflaging is less successful over time in girls

#### 1.1.7 Clinical bias in diagnostic process

There is a clinical bias among professionals (and caregivers)
1. [[Literature_review/cruz2024\|cruz2024]] – “The results support the argument of a bias in clinical procedures towards males”
2. [[Literature_review/young2018\|young2018]] – six studies showing barrier to females obtaining ASD diagnosis 1.1.8 Diagnostic criteria / new criteria needed
3. [[Literature_review/young2018\|young2018]] – “new diagnostic criteria, more sensitive to sex differences, may be necessary”

#### 1.1.9 Differences in co-occurring conditions / (women internalize difficulties vs men externalizing them)

1. [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]] - ”When comparing females and males with high ASD traits, it was found that males were more likely to have aggression and hyperactivity and/or attention deficits, and females were more likely to exhibit staring and seizure-like activities”
2. [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]], parents reported misdiagnosis as a factor leading to delayed diagnosis in female (C) ; all girls (C, 14 years) have at least on co-occurrence
3. [[Literature_review/ochoa-lubinoff2023\|ochoa-lubinoff2023]]- ”adolescent girls use more psychiatry and general emergency room services than do boys”
4. [[Literature_review/napolitano2022\|napolitano2022]]- ”specific types of anxiety symptoms could be more useful to highlight specific differences”
5. [[Literature_review/edwards2024a\|edwards2024a]]- anxiety and depression are common in autism, especially amongst female (internalizing vs externalizing for men)

### 1.2 Sex-gender similarities
Bias and delay might explain the differences in gender diagnostic rather than actual
female phenotype undocumented

#### 1.2.1 Core ASD features (social communication and interaction and RRBs), cognition and occurring conditions

1. [[Literature_review/natoli2023\|natoli2023]] – Results of the meta-analysis showed no sex differences in core autism features, cognition, or occurring conditions (social interaction, communication, visual reception, fine motor, receptive language, expressive language, internalizing and externalizing behaviors)
2. [[Literature_review/ochoa-lubinoff2023\|ochoa-lubinoff2023]] – “there is no simple sex dichotomy in ASD presentation nor a “female autism phenotype” that can be used to form diagnoses” ; “men and women may not vary on their autism severity scores on gold standard measures (. . . ) current diagnostic measures are appropriate for identifying autism in women, when women are referred for evaluation, highlighting the importance of timely evaluation referrals”

#### 1.2.2 Social communication
1. [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]] - ”This study ([Tillmann et al., ]) found no significant sex
differences relating to current social communication symptoms for either the ADOS
or the ADI-R, indicating a similar phenotype in terms of social communication
deficits for males and females meeting ASD diagnostic criteria, irrespective of age,
in a clinical sample.”
1. [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]] - boys and girls improve social communication abilities
over the lifetime
1. [[Literature_review/kok2016\|kok2016]] Men and women with ASD self-reported diminished empathy compared to typical men and women

#### 1.2.3 Cognitive
1. [[Literature_review/natoli2023\|natoli2023]] – reported that 10/16 studies evidenced no sex difference in cognition. Meta-analysis showed no sex difference for cognitive process

#### 1.2.4 Motor
1. [[Literature_review/natoli2023\|natoli2023]] – Results of the meta-analysis showed no sex differences in fine
motor process.

#### 1.2.5 Sensory sensitivities
1. [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]]- Parent-reported sensory symptoms significantly predicted an ASD diagnosis irrespective of gender
2. [[Literature_review/edwards2024a\|edwards2024a]] - No significant differences for sensory experiences

### 1.3 Barriers to diagnostic
#### 1.3.1 Self-evaluation tool could be a useful option
1. [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]]: ”One way to improve the diagnostic sensitivity and to identify the suffering related to compensation mechanisms could be to carry out a self-evaluation for adolescents and adults” (young women <21)

#### 1.3.2 Gender bias
1. [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]]: ”2 types of barriers: symptoms & behaviors (behavioral problem, social and communication abilities, add diagnosis / misdiagnosis, relationships, language, RRBIs) and perceived barriers to diagnosis (i.e. ASD considered boys disorder: parental concern, others’ perceptions, lack of information/resources, clinician bias, compensatory behaviors): existence of skepticism and disbelief”
2. [[Literature_review/young2021\|young2021]] : ”differences in the identification of symptoms between girls and boys may be due to the way they are explored rather than the way they are
measured”
3. [[Literature_review/ochoa-lubinoff2023\|ochoa-lubinoff2023]] : ”medical providers who have concerned about female patients’ social functioning should consider referrals to assessments services”
4. [[Literature_review/lockwoodestrin2021\|lockwoodestrin2021]]: ”motivation to have friends, girls face isolation, bullying and absenteeism, stress and anxiety” ([[Literature_review/cook2021\|cook2021]])

## 2 Use of advanced technology in ASD detection
### 2.1 Evidence for diagnosis improvement
#### 2.1.1 Reviews/meta reviews
1. [[Literature_review/bouchouras2025\|bouchouras2025]] - Systematic review showing that new technologies such as AI, IoT (Internet of Things), and sensor-based systems can improve autism diagnosis through non-invasive, real-time assessments (C)
2. [[Literature_review/liu2017\|liu2017]] - Technology-facilitated diagnosis and treatment can enable earlier, more accurate, and more cost-effective approaches for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (C and A).

#### 2.1.2 Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Eye Tracking
- [[Literature_review/rezayi2025\|rezayi2025]] – Highlight the potential and limitations of neuroimaging, EEG signal analysis, speech and crying signal analysis, eye tracking, facial recognition, and body movement analysis with ML in the context of ASD diagnosis (C and A)
- [[Literature_review/mukherjee2024\|mukherjee2024]] - Machine learning techniques can help with autism spectrum disorder detection through screening, feature extraction, classification, and outcome prediction (C)
- [Shahamiri et al., ]– A deep learning-based approach can improve the accuracy and intelligence of autism spectrum disorder screening (A).

#### 2.1.3 Wearable and smart devices
3. [Anzulewicz et al., ]. Smart tablet gameplay can identify children with autism based on their unique gesture patterns [C, 93%, N: 37 ASD,45 TD]
4. [[Literature_review/sharmin2018\|sharmin2018]], Wearable and smart devices show potential for detecting, diagnosing, and managing autism, but their effective utilization is still limited (C and A) [C, N/A, N/A]

#### 2.1.4 Digital behavioral screening apps
5. [[Literature_review/krishnappababu2024\|krishnappababu2024]] - A scalable and portable digital screening app can accurately detect autism in toddlers at home using computer vision and machine learning.[To, 84.3%+: 92.1%- N:188ASD, 432TD]
6. [[Literature_review/perochon2023a\|perochon2023a]] – A digital behavioral screening app showed high accuracy in detecting autism in young children.[C, 40%+:97%- 49 ASD:426 TD]

#### 2.1.5 Virtual reality
1. [[Literature_review/robles2022\|robles2022]] – A virtual reality system can accurately classify individuals with
autism spectrum disorders based on their behavioral responses during a social interaction.[A, 100%, 3 ASD:3 TD]

#### 2.1.6 Other (not covered here): genetic and biomarkers

### 2.2 limits
#### 2.2.1 How the ASD patient can get in touch with an expert
2. Discussion with experts, meeting with Loriane Caron
#### 2.2.2 Hardware limitations
1. [[Literature_review/cabibihan2016\|cabibihan2016]], summarizes many new technologies limitations for eye tracker, motion tracker, electrodermal activity, tactile sensors, vocal prosody and speech detector, and sleep quality assessment devices.
#### 2.2.3 ML and datas limitation
1. [[Literature_review/bouchouras2025\|bouchouras2025]]. ”One major limitation lies in the diversity and generalizability of the datasets used to develop these tools.”
2. [[Literature_review/hassan2024\|hassan2024]]: discusses the limitations of ML notably on overfitting due to small groups for training

#### 2.2.4 Research Vs clinic distance
1. [Chamak] [[Literature_review/milton2014\|milton2014]] : research priorities are disconnected from field needs (clinician and people with ASD) and improvement in participative is requested if social sciences/nonmedical perspective is to be brought
