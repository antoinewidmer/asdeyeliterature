| Eye Movement Metric                          | Findings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Source          |
| Fixation Stability                           | Individuals with ASD may have difficulty maintaining stable gaze, particularly without a visual target.1                                                                                                                                                                     |                 |
| Ocular Fixation Abnormality                  | Ocular fixation abnormality in ASD is related to how sensory and corollary discharge information is modified to motor commands, rather than motor execution or the suppression of reflexive saccades.2                                                                       |                 |
| Decreased Fixation Duration                  | A decreased fixation duration for social stimuli has been consistently identified in individuals with ASD. Autistic children demonstrate shorter fixation durations in positive emotional expressions compared to typically developing children during emotion recognition.3 | [[Zhang_2025\|Zhang_2025]]  |
| Reduced Eye Contact                          | Individuals with ASD often exhibit differences in social attention, including reduced eye contact and atypical gaze patterns during social interactions.4                                                                                                                    |                 |
| Atypical Gaze Patterns                       | People with ASD demonstrate atypical gaze to social scenes and socially salient aspects of the scenes and reduced gaze towards threat-related scenes.5                                                                                                                       |                 |
| Exploratory Gaze                             | Children with ASD explore an image more when first encountering it, which can be quantified using a new metric (Λ)6.6...                                                                                                                                                     |                 |
| Gaze variance                                | ASD subgroups diverged on this feature but both differed significantly from the neurotypical group8.4                                                                                                                                                                        |                 |
| Increased Saccade Frequency and Amplitude    | When a target is absent, the ASD group shows a rise in saccade frequency and amplitude9.9                                                                                                                                                                                    | [[Forbes_2025\|Forbes_2025]] |
| Prolonged Saccade Duration:                  | Saccade durations increased in ASD when the participants read the descriptions of scenarios and questions10.10                                                                                                                                                               |                 |
| GeoPref Test                                 | Yields few false positives (~ 2%) and is equally valid across demographic categories11.11                                                                                                                                                                                    |                 |
| New metric (Λ)                               | Λ quantifies how exploratory individuals are when encountering images, relies on only 5 s of eye-tracking data and is able to detect ASD in children with an accuracy of 93.9%7.7                                                                                            |                 |
| Time spent looking at face and mouth regions | For social interaction cognitive assessment, ASD spent significantly less time looking at the face and mouth regions compared to typically developing individuals12.12                                                                                                       |                 |
