### Details on the Get SET Early Model

The **Get SET Early** model (**S**creen, **E**valuate, **T**reat) is designed to improve **early autism spectrum disorder (ASD) detection and treatment referral** by integrating **systematic screening, immediate evaluation, and rapid treatment referral** into pediatric primary care settings.

---

### Objectives of Get SET Early

- Facilitate **early ASD detection**, ideally by **12-15 months**.
- Streamline **pediatrician decision-making** with **automated screening feedback**.
- Improve **referral rates** by addressing barriers like **pediatrician skepticism** and **parental uncertainty**.
- Ensure **rapid treatment engagement** through direct links with state-funded services.

---

### Key Features of Get SET Early

#### 1. Selection of a Broadband Screening Tool

- The **Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales (CSBS) Infant-Toddler Checklist** was chosen as it detects **a wide range of developmental delays** beyond ASD.
- This tool can be completed by parents in **~5 minutes**, making it **feasible in busy pediatric practices**.
- Screening was **repeated at 12, 18, and 24 months**, addressing variability in symptom emergence.

The **CSBS Checklist** consists of **24 questions** assessing **early communication, social, and play skills**. These questions are grouped into three main **subscales**:

| **Category**                 | **What It Measures**                                                                               | **Max Score** |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Social**                   | **Eye contact, joint attention, social interaction** (e.g., smiles at caregiver, responds to name) | **16 points** |
| **Speech/Language**          | **Vocalizations, word use, babbling, gesture use**                                                 | **28 points** |
| **Symbolic & Play Behavior** | **Pretend play, use of objects, exploration behaviors**                                            | **12 points** |
| **Total Score**              | Sum of all three categories                                                                        | **56 points** |

#### 2. Digital Screening Integration

- Pediatricians could choose **paper** or **iPad-based screening**.
    
- The **iPad version included:**
    
    - **Automated scoring**, eliminating manual errors.
    - **Immediate pass/fail feedback** for pediatricians.
    - **Pre-built referral tracking** (reason for non-referral logged automatically).
- **Impact of Digital Screening:**
    
    - Pediatricians using **digital tools referred 39.4%** of screen-positive toddlers.
    - In contrast, those using **paper forms did not reliably document referrals**, making it harder to track effectiveness.

---

#### 3. Pediatrician Network & Training

- **203 pediatricians** across **37 offices in San Diego County** participated.
    
- Training focused on:
    
    - **Recognizing early ASD signs**.
    - **Understanding screening tool sensitivity**.
    - **The importance of early intervention**.
    - **Overcoming hesitation to refer toddlers with failed screens**.
- Training occurred during **lunch-hour sessions**, ensuring **minimal disruption** to clinical workflows.
    

---

#### 4. Parent Concern as a Key Factor

- The CSBS Checklist included the question:  
    _‚ÄúDo you have any concerns about your child‚Äôs development?‚Äù_
    
- **Pediatricians were twice as likely to refer** if parents **expressed concern**, highlighting the **crucial role of parental input**.
    
- However:
    
    - Parents of **younger infants (12 months)** were **less likely to express concern**, reducing early referrals.
    - Parents of **older toddlers (18-24 months)** expressed **more concerns**, increasing referral rates.
- **Future solutions:** Enhance **parent education** and develop **passive monitoring tools** (e.g., **home-based video analysis**).
    

---

#### 5. Referral Tracking & Evaluation Pipeline

- **Pediatricians documented referral reasons in real-time**, allowing analysis of:
    
    - **Referral rates** (33% of screen-positive toddlers).
    - **Reasons for non-referral** (51% of the time, pediatricians ignored screen results due to skepticism).
    - **Age at first evaluation** (median: **19 months**, as early as **15 months for those screened at 12 months**).
- Referred toddlers were evaluated at the **UCSD Autism Diagnostic Center**, where:
    
    - Standardized tools (e.g., **ADOS-2, Mullen Scales of Early Learning**) were used for diagnosis.
    - **85% inter-rater reliability** was maintained among psychologists.

---

#### 6. Rapid Treatment Referral

- Following diagnosis, children were **immediately referred** for **state-funded therapy**.
    
- **San Diego Regional Center (SDRC)** covered treatment costs **regardless of insurance status**, ensuring:
    
    - **No financial barriers to treatment**.
    - **Consistent therapy access** for all referred toddlers.
- **Treatment statistics:**
    
    - **Median treatment start: 21 months**.
    - **Most received 7.6 hours/week** of **ABA-based therapy**, plus **speech and occupational therapy**.

---

### Model Refinements & Future Directions

The **Get SET Early model** is **iterative**, meaning it **evolves** based on collected data. Planned improvements include:

1. **Enhancing Pediatrician Training**
    
    - Addressing **cognitive biases** in non-referral decisions.
    - Introducing **AI-assisted referral guidance**.
2. **Incorporating Additional Screening Layers**
    
    - **AI-driven behavioral analysis** (e.g., **eye-tracking, gesture analysis**).
    - **Parental video submissions** for remote ASD screening.
3. **Longitudinal Tracking of Treatment Outcomes**
    
    - Studying **long-term benefits** of **earlier interventions**.
    - Exploring **optimal therapy models** for toddlers diagnosed via **Get SET Early**.

### Final Thoughts

The **Get SET Early** model represents **a scalable approach** to **real-world ASD screening**. Its success in San Diego suggests it could be **replicated in other regions**, potentially incorporating **AI-driven enhancements** to further **reduce pediatrician hesitation** and **increase diagnostic accuracy**.
