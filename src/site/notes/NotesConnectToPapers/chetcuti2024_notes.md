## 📌 Summary

- **Objective:**
    - Evaluate the feasibility and preliminary validity of the **Gazefinder eye-tracking system** in detecting early autism-related behaviors in **infants aged 9–14 months**.
    - Assess whether eye-tracking can be reliably integrated into clinical autism evaluations.
    - Examine associations between gaze behaviors and autism-related behaviors.
- **Significance:**
    - **Early autism detection is crucial**, yet current diagnostic tools rely heavily on subjective assessments.
    - **Objective, scalable eye-tracking** may provide a **standardized biomarker** for early autism identification.

## 🔬 Methods

### Participants

- **Total Participants:** **54 clinically referred infants (9–14 months old)**
    - **Referred due to early signs of autism** based on the Social Attention and Communication Surveillance–Revised (SACS-R) tool.
    - 10 infants (18.5%) reported that their infant had an older autistic sibling
    - Each infant was referred to the larger study by a community health practitioner on the basis of showing three- (26%), four- (26%), or five (48%) of five SACS-R eligibility markers  suggesting possible emerging autism24
- **Clinical Assessments Used:**
    - **Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI)** → Measures early autism behaviors.
    - **Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL)** → Assesses cognitive development.
    - **Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS-II)** → Evaluates adaptive skills.
    - **Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R)** → Measures temperament.

### Tasks for participants

Each infant viewed a **standardized sequence of animations** featuring **social vs. non-social stimuli**, designed to measure **visual attention preferences**. The **task categories** were:

1. **Human Face Trials**
    
    - **Static and animated faces** (eyes blinking, mouth moving, talking).
    - **Key Comparison:** Gaze towards **eyes vs. mouth**.
2. **People vs. Geometry Trials**
    
    - **Paired social (people) vs. non-social (geometric patterns)**.
    - **Key Comparison:** Gaze towards **social vs. non-social stimuli**.
3. **Biological Motion Trials**
    
    - **Point-light displays (PLDs)** depicting **upright vs. inverted human movement**.
    - **Key Comparison:** Gaze towards **upright vs. inverted motion**.
4. **Referential Attention Trials**
    
    - **Agent interacting with an object (e.g., pointing)**.
    - **Key Comparison:** Gaze towards **target object vs. distractor**.

### System setup and hardware

- **Device Used:** **Gazefinder GP-100EA (50 Hz sampling rate)**
- **Screen:** 19-inch display (1280 × 1024 pixels).
- **Stimuli:** **‘Scene 1S4’ autism assessment animation (2 minutes total)**.
- **Setup:** Infants sat on a caregiver’s lap while viewing the screen.
- **Calibration:** 5-point gaze calibration before testing.

### Data Analysis

The study measured **four key eye-tracking metrics**:

|**Category**|**Metric**|**Definition**|
|---|---|---|
|**Fixation-Based Metrics**|**Fixation Duration**|% of time spent looking at a specific ROI (eyes, mouth, objects, geometry).|
|**Fixation-Based Metrics**|**First Fixation**|Which area (social or non-social) the infant looked at first.|
|**Gaze Transition Metrics**|**Alternation Rate**|Number of gaze shifts between social and non-social stimuli.|
|**Gaze Transition Metrics**|**Dwell Time**|Duration of gaze fixation on one stimulus before switching.|

✅ **Main Finding:** **Infants with more autism behaviors had a stronger preference for non-social stimuli (geometry).**

## 📊 Results & Key Findings

### **1️⃣ High Feasibility of Eye-Tracking in Infants**

- **77% average tracking rate** (percentage of the task where valid gaze data was captured).
- **80% of infants successfully completed the protocol**.
- **No significant issues in calibration or data collection.**

### **2️⃣ Autism-Linked Differences in Visual Attention**

- **Infants with more autism-related behaviors (higher AOSI scores):**
    - Spent **more time looking at non-social stimuli (geometry)**.
    - Had **lower gaze alternation rates** (less switching between social/non-social images).
    - Showed **reduced gaze towards the eyes** in face trials.
    - No significant differences in gaze behavior for **biological motion or referential attention trials**.

### **3️⃣ No Significant Association with General Development**

- **Fixation patterns were not correlated with cognitive (MSEL) or adaptive skills (VABS-II).**
- **Gaze behavior seems to be a specific marker of autism, not general cognitive ability.**
