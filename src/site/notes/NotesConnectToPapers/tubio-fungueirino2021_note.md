## Background & Objective

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is diagnosed more frequently in males than females, with a male-to-female ratio of about 4:1. However, this discrepancy might be due to **social camouflaging**, a phenomenon in which autistic females hide or compensate for their autistic traits to fit into social norms. This study systematically reviews empirical research on the camouflaging effect in females with ASD, aiming to understand its causes, mechanisms, and consequences.

## Methods

- A systematic review was conducted following **PRISMA guidelines**.
- The authors searched four databases (**PubMed, Web of Science, PsychInfo, and Scopus**) for studies published between **2009 and 2019**.
- **Inclusion criteria**: Empirical studies that investigated camouflaging, masking, imitation, or compensation behaviors in autistic females.
- **Final selection**: **13 studies** were included in the review.

## Key Findings

1. **Causes of Camouflaging**
    
    - **Social expectations & gender norms**: Females, in general, face more **pressure to conform** to social norms than males, which may drive autistic females to camouflage their traits.
    - **Avoiding stigma and bullying**: Camouflaging helps autistic females **avoid rejection and social isolation**.
    - **Desire for social relationships**: Many autistic females genuinely want to **form friendships** despite difficulties in social interaction.
2. **How Females with ASD Camouflage Their Symptoms**
    
    - **Mimicry and imitation**: Copying peersâ€™ social behaviors, gestures, and speech patterns.
    - **Masking difficulties**: Suppressing autistic traits, such as avoiding stimming behaviors.
    - **Using social scripts**: Rehearsing conversations and memorizing responses to navigate social interactions.
    - **Adopting personas**: Creating an artificial social identity to blend in.
3. **Negative Consequences of Camouflaging**
    
    - **Delayed or missed diagnosis**: Many females with ASD **go undiagnosed or receive a late diagnosis** because they do not present the "typical" male-dominated ASD traits.
    - **Emotional and psychological distress**: Camouflaging is **mentally exhausting**, leading to **anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem**.
    - **Identity confusion**: Some individuals feel like they are "faking" their personality, leading to **loss of self-identity**.
    - **Increased risk of burnout**: Continuous masking can lead to **autistic burnout**, where individuals experience extreme exhaustion and mental breakdowns.
4. **Cognitive and Neurological Associations**
    
    - **Executive function advantage**: Autistic females may have better executive functioning skills, which could facilitate camouflaging.
    - **Brain structure differences**: Neuroimaging studies found that **autistic females show different brain activation patterns**, particularly in the **prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and amygdala**.
    - **Linguistic camouflaging**: Some autistic females use more sophisticated **verbal strategies**, such as **using "UM" more often than "UH" to appear socially adept**.
5. **Camouflaging in Different Age Groups**
    
    - **Children**: Autistic girls engage in **social imitation** and have **more social interests** (e.g., in animals or people) than autistic boys.
    - **Adolescents**: Increased awareness of **social expectations** leads to higher camouflaging efforts.
    - **Adults**: Many undiagnosed autistic women struggle with **mental health issues** due to years of masking their autistic traits.

## Implications

- **Need for gender-sensitive diagnostic criteria**: Current ASD diagnostic tools are **based on male presentations**, leading to underdiagnosis in females.
- **Importance of early intervention**: Recognizing camouflaging behaviors in young girls can help clinicians **identify ASD earlier and provide support**.
- **Rethinking autism support strategies**: More resources are needed to help autistic females **manage camouflaging-related stress and mental health challenges**.

## Conclusion

The study highlights that **social camouflaging is a major factor contributing to the underdiagnosis of autism in females**. While camouflaging may help autistic females navigate social interactions, it also comes with **serious psychological consequences**. Future research should focus on developing **better diagnostic tools, support systems, and interventions** that account for gender differences in autism presentation.
