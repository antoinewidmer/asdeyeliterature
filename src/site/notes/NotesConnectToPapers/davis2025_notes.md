## üìå Summary

- The study investigates early **behavioral characteristics** in toddlers who were later diagnosed with **autism (ASD), ADHD symptoms, or both**.
- **506 toddlers** from a longitudinal study were analyzed based on **parent questionnaires at two time points**.
- Four groups were identified: **Autism (n=45), ADHD (n=70), Autism+ADHD (n=30), and Neurotypical (n=361)**.
- Findings indicate that toddlers later identified with **both Autism and ADHD** had **higher levels of behavioral challenges**, including **social-emotional difficulties and higher parental stress levels**.
- ADHD symptoms were **evident in toddlerhood**, supporting **early screening for ADHD alongside autism**.

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Design

- **Longitudinal study** conducted in **four pediatric primary care clinics**.
- Parent-reported behavior data collected at **two time points** (18-24 months & ~36 months).
- Diagnostic classifications were **confirmed through research evaluations and electronic health records**.

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings:

- **Toddlers later identified with Autism+ADHD showed the most severe behavioral difficulties.**
- **Autism+ADHD group exhibited higher externalizing & internalizing behaviors than Autism-only or ADHD-only groups.**
- **ADHD symptoms were evident by toddlerhood**, supporting **early ADHD screening alongside autism.**
- **Parents of Autism+ADHD toddlers reported significantly greater stress and support needs.**
- **Gender differences:**
    - **Boys had higher Autism and ADHD scores.**
    - **Girls had lower reported ADHD and Autism symptoms.**

### Implications for the Project

- **Supports the need for early, dual screening for both ASD and ADHD.**
- **Emphasizes the importance of parent-reported measures in early identification.**
- **Highlights the necessity for tailored intervention strategies for children with Autism+ADHD.**
- **Suggests that diagnostic delays in ADHD may be problematic for early intervention efforts.**

## üîç Related Work

- **Builds on prior research (Hong et al., 2021)** showing **high ADHD symptoms in young autistic children**.
- **Aligns with studies (Gadow et al., 2006; Lecavalier et al., 2011)** confirming **preschool-age ADHD identification.**
- **Confirms earlier findings (Rommelse et al., 2010)** that **Autism+ADHD is associated with lower adaptive behavior.**

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

‚úÖ **Large sample size (506 toddlers), diverse racial and socioeconomic representation.**  
‚úÖ **Use of longitudinal data increases reliability of findings.**  
‚úÖ **Gold-standard diagnostic tools (ADOS-2, CARS-2, M-CHAT-R/F, ADHD-RS) used for validation.**  
‚úÖ **Incorporates real-world clinical data from electronic health records (EHR).**  
‚úÖ **First study to track early ADHD symptoms in toddlers later diagnosed with Autism+ADHD.**

### Major Concerns and Challenges

‚ö† **Parent-reported data may introduce bias**

- Relies **heavily on subjective questionnaires** rather than **direct behavioral observations**.
- No **teacher or clinician ratings for cross-validation**.

‚ö† **Small Autism+ADHD sample (n=30) weakens statistical power**

- A **larger sample** is needed to **confirm findings on Autism+ADHD differences**.

‚ö† **Potential Socioeconomic Bias**

- **Higher-income, more-educated families were overrepresented** in the sample.
- **Low-income families less likely to have completed follow-ups**, affecting generalizability.

‚ö† **COVID-19 Disruptions May Have Impacted Data**

- **Some diagnostic evaluations were conducted via telehealth**, which **may be less accurate** than in-person assessments.
- **Study attrition was high**, potentially **excluding families facing greater challenges**.

‚ö† **No Direct Assessment of Attention in Autism**

- **The study lacks eye-tracking or gaze-based assessments** for objective attention measurement.


### **Final Verdict: Strong but Needs Refinement**

‚úÖ **Provides critical evidence that ADHD symptoms appear in toddlerhood**.  
‚úÖ **Supports early screening for both ASD and ADHD.**  
‚ö† **Needs more objective measures, larger Autism+ADHD sample, and better socioeconomic representation.**
