## üìå Summary

- **Objective**: The study examines **variability in early socio-communicative skills** in young autistic children and how these skills influence later **cognitive and adaptive development**.
- **Participants**: **171 children (103 with ASD, 68 typically developing [TD])** aged **18‚Äì60 months** were assessed longitudinally.
- **Method**: Used **Early Social Communication Scales (ESCS)** to measure preverbal communication and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to identify key behavioral patterns.
- **Findings**:
    - **Autistic children had consistently lower preverbal communication skills** than TD children, but some skills improved by age 5.
    - **Two major components of social communication** emerged:
        1. **Object-directed behaviors** (e.g., pointing, reaching).
        2. **Social interaction-directed behaviors** (e.g., turn-taking, social gaze).
    - **Cluster analysis identified three ASD subgroups**, each with different communication profiles and developmental trajectories.
    - Children with **strong early social interaction skills had better cognitive and adaptive outcomes** later.
- **Implications**: Findings **support early intervention tailored to specific preverbal communication profiles** in ASD.

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Key Findings:

- **TD children consistently outperformed ASD children in preverbal communication skills**, but both groups showed improvement over time.
- **Two major social communication factors were identified**:
    1. **Object-directed behaviors** (pointing, reaching, responding to requests).
    2. **Social interaction behaviors** (turn-taking, facial engagement).
- **Cluster analysis revealed three ASD subgroups**:
    - **Cluster A**: Strong object-directed skills, weak social engagement.
    - **Cluster B**: Balanced mix of object and social interaction skills.
    - **Cluster C**: Weak in both object and social engagement (poorest developmental outcomes).
- **Children in Cluster C had the worst cognitive and adaptive functioning trajectories**.
- **Initiation of behavioral requests (pointing, reaching) was the strongest predictor of later language and social development**.

### Implications for the Project

- **Supports personalized intervention strategies based on preverbal communication profiles**.
- **Highlights the role of nonverbal communication as a predictor of later cognitive and social outcomes**.
- **Suggests that object-directed skills (pointing, reaching) should be a focus in early intervention**.
- **Findings could inform AI-driven assessment tools for early ASD screening**.

## üîç Related Work

- **Extends previous findings (Chiang et al., 2008) that ASD children struggle with high-level joint attention behaviors**.
- **Supports Mundy et al. (2007), who found that early social communication deficits persist into preschool years**.
- **Contrasts with some studies (Bottema-Beutel, 2016), which argue that response to joint attention is more important than initiation**.
- **Provides new evidence linking social engagement skills with long-term cognitive outcomes**.

### Major Concerns and Challenges

‚ö† **Potential Overinterpretation of Clusters**

- **Do these subgroups represent meaningful clinical differences, or are they just statistical artifacts?**
- **Need validation in an independent dataset** before using these subgroups for clinical decision-making.

‚ö† **Limited Generalizability**

- **Participants were recruited from a single research center** ‚Üí Findings may not generalize to more diverse populations.
- **Cultural and linguistic background differences** were not analyzed.

‚ö† **Lack of Direct Real-World Interaction Measurements**

- Study **relies on structured lab-based tasks** rather than **real-world social interactions**.
- **Would be stronger with parent-reported naturalistic observations**.

‚ö† **Possible Intervention Bias**

- Some children **may have received early intervention**, influencing their developmental trajectories.
- **No information on intervention history was controlled for in the analysis**.

‚ö† **No Neurobiological Correlates**

- Would benefit from **neuroimaging or physiological measures** to link behavioral findings to brain function.
