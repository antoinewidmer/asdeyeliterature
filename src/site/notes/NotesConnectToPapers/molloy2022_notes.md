## Summary

- Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a **highly heterogeneous condition** with significant variability in **clinical symptoms, biological underpinnings, and developmental trajectories**.
- The **lack of consistent biomarkers** for ASD diagnosis is attributed to this **phenotypic and etiological heterogeneity**, suggesting the existence of **distinct autism subgroups ("autisms")**.
- **Stratification biomarkers** aim to identify these **subgroups based on shared biological features** to improve the **predictive power of biomarkers** and guide **personalized interventions**.
- The paper emphasizes the importance of **precision medicine**—tailoring treatments to individuals based on **genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors**.
- **Biomarker research** has traditionally focused on **diagnostic biomarkers** but is now shifting toward **stratification biomarkers** to predict **response to interventions** and identify **optimal treatment timing**.

## Key Areas of Biomarker Research in ASD

1. **Molecular Biomarkers**:
    
    - **Genetics, proteomics, metabolomics** have revealed **disrupted neuronal signaling, immune dysfunction, and altered synaptic plasticity**.
    - **Rare genetic variants** (e.g., CNVs) contribute to ASD risk but show **significant overlap with other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia)**.
    - The genetic heterogeneity complicates biomarker development, as many **autism-associated variants** affect **general neurodevelopmental pathways**.
2. **Neuroimaging Biomarkers**:
    
    - Early **MRI studies** found **abnormal brain growth trajectories** in ASD, including **frontal and amygdala overgrowth** in infancy.
    - **Resting-state fMRI** indicates **local hyperconnectivity and long-range hypoconnectivity** in ASD, but **results vary across studies**.
    - Differences in **brain lateralization** and **functional connectivity patterns** have been proposed as **potential stratification biomarkers**.
3. **Electrophysiological Biomarkers**:
    
    - **Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)**, especially the **N170 component**, show **delayed latencies for face processing in ASD**.
    - However, **high variability and small effect sizes** limit its reliability as a **standalone biomarker**.
4. **Eye-Tracking Biomarkers**:
    
    - **Reduced attention to social stimuli in infancy** is **one of the most replicated findings** in ASD.
    - Gaze-tracking measures are being explored as **early biomarkers for social communication deficits**.

## Challenges in ASD Biomarker Research

- **High inter-individual variability** makes it difficult to identify **consistent patterns** across individuals.
- **Developmental changes over time** further complicate **biomarker consistency**.
- **Co-occurring conditions (e.g., ADHD, anxiety)** blur the line between **autism-specific and general neurodevelopmental markers**.
- **Limited cross-study consistency** arises from differences in **data acquisition, analytic techniques, and population sampling**.

## Proposed Solutions and Future Directions

- Shift from **binary diagnostic biomarkers** to **stratification biomarkers** that **identify biologically relevant subgroups**.
- Embrace **large-scale, longitudinal datasets** like **EU-AIMS LEAP** to capture **developmental trajectories**.
- Develop **multi-biomarker profiles** integrating **genetic, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and behavioral data**.
- Apply **machine learning techniques** to **disentangle heterogeneity** and **personalize interventions**.
- Advocate for **cross-disorder approaches** to understand **shared and disorder-specific biomarkers**.

## Possible Subgroups
### Subgroups Based on Behavioral Phenotypes

- **Socially Avoidant vs. Socially Passive:**
    
    - Some autistic individuals actively **avoid social interactions**, while others exhibit **passive behavior and limited social engagement**.
    - These subgroups differ in their **neural processing of social cues** and may **respond differently to social skills interventions**.
- **High Sensory Sensitivity vs. Low Sensory Sensitivity:**
    
    - **Increased sensory reactivity** can lead to **avoidance behaviors** and **social withdrawal**.
    - **Low sensory reactivity** may correspond to **reduced attention to environmental cues**.
- **Language Profile Subgroups:**
    
    - **Early language delays** often correlate with **rightward brain asymmetry**.
    - Some individuals show **intact non-verbal communication** but **impaired verbal abilities**, while others present the **opposite pattern**.

### Developmental Trajectory Subgroups (Longitudinal Perspective)

- **Early Onset vs. Late Onset ASD:**
    
    - **Early-onset ASD** is characterized by **observable social communication deficits before 2 years**.
    - **Late-onset ASD** may present with **typical development in infancy**, followed by **regression around 18–24 months**.
- **Stable vs. Dynamic Trajectories:**
    
    - Some individuals exhibit **stable behavioral profiles** throughout development, while others show **significant improvement or deterioration** over time.

### Subgroups Based on Co-Occurring Conditions

- **ASD + ADHD:**
    
    - Co-occurring **attention deficits and hyperactivity** predict **greater functional impairment**.
- **ASD + Anxiety/Depression:**
    
    - **Internalizing symptoms** often accompany **higher social motivation** but **greater social anxiety**.
- **ASD + Intellectual Disability (ID):**
    
    - Co-occurring **intellectual impairment** is associated with **distinct neural connectivity patterns** and **greater language challenges**.

### Conclusion: The Need for Stratification Biomarkers

The paper argues that the **clinical, biological, and behavioral heterogeneity of ASD** necessitates the development of **robust stratification biomarkers** to:

- **Identify biologically relevant ASD subgroups**.
- **Personalize treatment plans** based on **unique biomarker profiles**.
- **Predict long-term developmental trajectories**.
- **Improve the reliability of biomarker-based ASD diagnostic tools**.

## Conclusion

- **Stratification biomarkers** hold promise in **addressing ASD heterogeneity** by **defining subgroups based on shared biological characteristics**.
- These biomarkers can **improve treatment personalization** by **predicting therapy responses** and **guiding early interventions**.
- However, **biomarker development remains in early stages**, requiring **replication in large, diverse, and longitudinal cohorts**.
