## üìñ Summary

- **Objective/Purpose:**
    - Investigate the potential of virtual reality (VR) systems to enhance diagnostic assessment for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
    - Examine how VR technologies can boost ASD traits that might be missed with traditional diagnostic tools.
- **Scope of the Review:**
    - Systematic review of 20 peer-reviewed studies focusing on ASD assessment using VR.
    - Explores communication, social interaction, cognitive functioning, sensory processing, and motor behavior.
- **Key Inclusion Criteria:**
    - Studies including participants with clinically diagnosed ASD.
    - Comparative analysis between ASD and typically developing (TD) participants.
    - Published in the last 10 years, written in English, with primary research data.
- **Key Exclusion Criteria:**
    - Studies focused solely on intervention or rehabilitation.
    - Reviews, meta-analyses, protocols, and studies without full-text access.

|**Category**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Review Type**|Systematic Review|
|**Number of Studies**|20|
|**Study Focus**|ASD assessment using VR|
|**Key Domains**|Communication, cognition, sensory processing, motor behavior|

## üî¨ Methods

### Study Selection & Data Sources

- **Databases searched:** PubMed, IEEE Xplore.
- **Keywords used:** ("autism" OR "autistic") AND ("virtual reality" OR "augmented reality") AND ("diagnosis OR assessment").
- **Screening process:**
    - Titles and abstracts screened by two independent reviewers.
    - Discrepancies resolved by consensus.
- **Final inclusion:** 20 studies.

### Data Extraction & Quality Assessment

- **Data Extractors:** Two independent reviewers.
- **Tools Used:** Rayyan software.
- **Bias Assessment:** Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.

### Meta-Analysis Methods

- Statistical approaches included descriptive and comparative analysis.
- Heterogeneity evaluated using I¬≤ statistic.
- Machine learning techniques applied to eye gaze and motor behavior data.

## üìä Results & Key Findings

### Overview of Included Studies

|**Aspect**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Number of Studies**|20|
|**Sample Size Range**|6 to 92 participants|
|**Study Designs**|Cross-sectional, case-control, observational|
|**Geographical Distribution**|Primarily Europe and North America|

### Main Findings

- **VR boosts ASD traits**: ASD participants displayed distinct patterns in gaze behavior, social interaction, and motor function.
    
- **Eye tracking metrics**: ASD individuals spent less time looking at socially relevant areas.
    
- **Motor behavior differences**: Greater variability and reduced motor control in ASD participants.
    
- **Machine learning potential**: High accuracy in ASD classification using gaze and motor data.
    
- **Heterogeneity & Publication Bias:**
    
    - High methodological variability across studies.
    - No strong evidence of publication bias identified.

## üîç Related Work & Theoretical Framework

- **Previous Reviews:** Most prior studies focused on VR interventions rather than diagnostic applications.
- **Theoretical Frameworks:** Utilized cognitive and motor behavior theories, especially for gaze behavior analysis.

## üìù Observations

### Strengths of the Study

‚úÖ **Novel Application:** Highlights the potential of VR for ASD diagnosis rather than just intervention.  
‚úÖ **Methodological Rigor:** Systematic approach with clear inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
‚úÖ **Innovative Insights:** Reveals behavioral markers in ASD that are less observable in traditional settings.  
‚úÖ **Machine Learning Integration:** Demonstrates the value of computational methods in diagnostic refinement.

### Major Concerns & Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Sample Size:** Most studies included small sample sizes.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Study Variability:** Differences in VR setups and metrics limit cross-study comparability.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Age Range Restrictions:** Few studies included very young or older populations.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Ecological Validity:** Uncertain generalizability from VR to real-world settings.

## üöÄ Conclusion & Future Directions

- **Clinical Implications:** VR systems can serve as objective tools to supplement traditional ASD diagnostic methods.
- **Research Recommendations:**
    - Increase sample sizes.
    - Standardize VR protocols across studies.
    - Further explore motor and gaze-based biomarkers.
